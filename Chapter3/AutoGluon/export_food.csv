  I’ve been ordering this product monthly for over a year. These past few shipments have been off, and the packaging is different. It is obvious they are from two different manufacturers. The full bottle is the imposter and has no pink ribbon on the label, the label photo is different, and if you look at the bottle, you can see on the back that the legitimate product has a 3% Juice Content label on the back up top, and the imposter has a 1% Juice Content. There are also other differences on the label. See Photos for comparison. Two different products, and the IMPOSTER is absolutely undrinkable and tastes nothing like the original product.I contacted Amazon and they are pulling this flavor, Red Grapefruit, off the shelf while they investigate this issue. They also issued me a full credit. I hope they can get this figured out because this is my favorite flavor and I drink it everyday.

  I used to drink these Sparkling Ice waters in all flavors every day.  They all taste GREAT, my favorite was Black Raspberry. However, I just discovered that they contain sucralose which is just another harmful artificial sweetener. The only safe sweeteners are Stevia, Agave, and Raw Honey.  I have stopped drinking/eating anything with harmful artificial sweeteners since they have been linked to many diseases, including dementia and the increase in Atzheimers disease patients.

  Update March 2019: I have been a regular subscriber of 3 cases a month of Sparkling Ice for a few years. I LOVED the stuff. It was plenty diabetic/keto-friendly with its 3% real juice and it tasted not merelt great, but REALISTIC. Then, sometime in the last year or so, I just stopped wanting to drink it as much. The flavor was no longer exciting. The mock mulled cider I made with it this Christmas fell flat. I thought I’d just lost my taste for it until I saw that another reviewer had noticed that the juice content went from 3% to 1%. I looked at my bottles and all the flavors indeed now say 1% juice.The company said it was to conform to its zero-sugar claim but I don’t believe it - 3% of 179mL (one serving) would be about 5g of juice, which would contain about half a gram of sugar, which can legally be labeled as 0 grams. They could have replaced the aromatics and maintained the flavor but that would probably have been more expensive than just using real juice.Now these drinks taste about the same as any other diet soda. The flavors are now flat instead of complex and realistic like they used to be.I AM CANCELLING MY SUBSCRIPTION FOR ALL THREE CASES PER MONTH. ARE YOU LISTENING, TALKING RAIN INC?I also intend to complain to Amazon about allowing Sparkling Ice to keep its past high ratings for what is no longer the same product. It is very misleading if reviews don’t all refer to the same thing being reviewed.Old review: Crisp Apple Sparkling Ice tastes almost exactly like Martinelli's sparkling ciderBeing on a carb-restricted diet, one of the things I miss most is the taste of fruit, and especially the intense flavor of fruit juices. To my palate (accustomed as it is to most artificial sweeteners), Crisp Apple Sparkling Ice tastes almost exactly like Martinelli's sparkling cider.Crisp Apple, Coconut Pineapple, and Pink Grapefruit are in my opinion, the most realistic flavors of Sparkling Ice.At $1 a bottle, it's not quite cheap but it is an affordable treat.Update: at Christmastime, I used Crisp Apple as a base for zero-carb mulled “cider.” Lacking proper mulling spices, a Constant Comment tea bag with its cinnamon/orange peel/clove flavoring did the trick nicely. A touch of malic acid restored the tanginess lost from heating the fizz (carbonic acid) out of it.

  I don't drink this myself, I buy it for my dad who I swear would drink it by the gallon if offered. He is diabetic and we have been trying to get him off of diet soda for a long time, this is better for him.I have no complaints about the product, I do wish amazon would do a better job keeping this flavor in stock, this is his favorite flavor and nearly impossible to find. I want to do a subscribe and save on it, hopefully amazon can get that going.

  When I received my package I couldn't believe my eyes. All twelve bottles were filled with a clear liquid (not green in color at all!) The labeling was correct ""Sparkling Ice Lemon Lime"" So we tasted it and all it was, was Seltzer Water. Yuck. What a waste of my money. It's too heavy for me to return it so we just drained them and threw the bottles away. What I don't understand is that I always order this with no problems ever. This will be the last time I ever buy this on line again. Just Weird!

  I was not impressed with this last batch I received. I use the subscribe & save feature every month and have been ordering the strawberry watermelon sparkling ice for a few years now. The products I received before were much darker in color this last shipment I received looked like the grapefruit sparkling ice product not the strawberry watermelon one I usually get. It also had stains at the top of the cap that were darker then the product itself. The drink even tasted strange. So I contacted amazon for a refund and was issued one very fast. I then contacted talking rain, the company that makes sparkling ice, to inform them of this issue. I sent pictures to them, they said it was safe to drink but I don’t trust it. I ended up throwing the 12 pack away. Picture 1 is a comparison, picture 2, 3 and 4 are the new product and the last 2 pictures are the old version.

  I first tried these just a few weeks ago after noticing them being promoted in our local grocery store, packaged in Seattle Seahawks colors.The taste is quite sweet, and carbonated, and I generally prefer to drink these over ice so they stay cold as well as become a bit diluted as the ice melts. The various fruit flavors are all very nice and I generally purchase the 

Variety Pack

   although I also have purchased the 

Cherry Limeade

   flavor. I have only tried this in the tall thin plastic containers, 17 ounce size, which are comfortable to hold in the hand.Much of the flavor and sweetness comes from natural fruit extracts, although these drinks do contain an artificial sweetener - sucralose - which is commonly available as 

Splenda No Calorie Sweetener

  . I have mixed feelings about consuming anything artificial, but for the moment at least I am comfortable drinking this.My first choice for thirst quenching during the day and with dinner is still water (I prefer 

San Pellegrino, Sparking Natural Mineral Water

   which I purchase in the glass bottles locally), and I drink filtered water from the dispenser at my office during the day. But once a day or so I will treat myself to a sweet flavored drink, and at the present time this Sparkling Ice is my favorite.It was convenient to purchase from Amazon and the cost was comparable to what I pay locally.

  I don't usually review stuff but this deserves a review  This is my favorite flavor and I can no longer find it locally. I decided to try amazon and see how it went. I am impressed. Free shipping and a decent price and, and I had my doubts about this as I am in North Pole Alaska, it didn't get frozen on the journey.  Now I have all the sparkling ice I want, in the flavor I want, without the frustration of trying to find it locally. (They apparently discontinued the flavor. Then had my next favorite back ordered for three months. A couple weeks after I bought this, the vendors stocking at one of the stores I go to spotted me and showed me how they finally got my second favorite flavor in. I just told them I am now getting it from amazon.)Btw.  The reason this product is so important to me is that it is fabulously flavorful, sweet tasting but not too sweet, and the biggest reason is that despite all that, it has zero calories and carbs.  Being a diabetic, that is a biggie. I don't drink soda pop but was REALLY getting tired of water. It even has some nutritional value. Awesome product and amazon really has it together with the shopping, what with it getting here without freezing, and you know what carbonated drinks do when they freeze, and the subscription service makes it super easy to keep it around.

  I have ordered here a few times before and they were good but the case I got this last time tasted bad with a weird after taste. Even the color was off- lighter than normal. Not happy with this order. Prior to this I was subscribed to receive a monthly case and was buying another case around mid month. Because of this I have canceled my monthly subscription. In the attached photo you can see the darker one is a drink I bought today at the store, as they normally look. The lighter one is the gross one I ordered from amazon. Waste of money.

  OMG we love this stuff and the grapefruit flavor isn't always easy to find. It tastes like Fresca but with vitamins and seems to be a healthier option to sodas and sweet fruit drinks. A nice change when you want something fizzy but not sugar-sweetened and it has no sodium which is good for people who can't have salt.

  I have ordered this beverage several times over the past 2 years. I truly enjoyed the beverage however , the last shipment didn’t taste right but I had a cold  and attributed the foul chemical taste to my illness. Additionally, I noticed that my thirst was not quenched.  Today a new shipment arrived. The color of the grapefruit beverage was a dark pink , the taste was worse than the prior shipment.  The harsh chemical  aftertastes were Frightening. I had terrible heartburn as well.  I hope amazon investigates the issue and pulls the product off the website. It’s one thing to purchase counterfeit merchandise , no one gets poisoned but to sell items that amazon has already been notified about by others is truly wrong. (I just read another post like mine )Keep away !

  Over the years strawberry watermelon was very good. I ordered it every month through the subscription. The last time receiving it, it was of poor quality. The color changed and it taste horrible. I immediately changed my subscription for next month. This is the second flavor I’ve had to change due to the color change and taste. I hope this is not an indication of what’s to come with the other flavors. I am very disappointed because I truly loved strawberry watermelon. If I could give 0 as a rating I would.

  I had been looking for grapefruit flavored soda for quite awhile when I came across Ice.  It tasted great so I started purchasing different flavors.  Some I like a lot, some are ok and some I don't care for.  I'm not going to lower my star rating just because I didn’t like a flavor.  My go to flavors are black cherry, black raspberry, grapefruit and any of the lemonades/limeades.  I have the new grape raspberry on order and I'm guessing I will like that too.  Price wise:  just wait a while until your flavor drops back to $12.  I find the prices fluctuate quite a bit so if a favorite isn't $12, I try something new.  Can anyone tell me why ICE is bottled in 17 oz containers when the rest of the beverage world are 16 oz?

  My husband loves these ice drinks. He doesn’t drink much diet soda but is diabetic and finds this a nice alternative to water or soda for a treat. His favorite flavors are cherry, black raspberry, kiwi strawberry  and cherry limeade.  We buy about 3 cases a month from this seller and find them to be a bit cheaper here. At a big box store sometimes the multi pack can be cheaper but then you get a mixture of flavors. He only has those few he loves so being that they are always at least 1$ each at the store but normally 1.25$ this is a better buy. Plus i get to skip a trip to the store and carry those heavy bags that hold individual bottles.Bottom line if you buy these often get the case. Much cheaper and convenient.

  This variety pack has some of the tastier flavors of Sparkling Ice. My husband thinks that any flavor with lemon in it tastes like janitor in a drum -> but the limeade is okay. My family likes it, and I am fine with them drinking it in moderation. It has artificial colors, flavors, and sucralose. It also has vitamins and green tea extract, and the bottles are BPA free. So, a bit of a mixed bag, but good in a household where we are eliminating aspartame and trying to cut down on caffeine.

  This is my first adventure in taste titillation with this gift of a thirst quenching, body nourishing, energy giving, refreshing, tasty, effervescent elixir whose formula I believe was given to the company by space aliens who did not want to see the American people suffer with overly sugary, caloric empty calorie brown bubbly water that has not even seen a cola nut. These ""Sparkling Ice"" refreshments that the benefactor aliens instructed the company to make have 0 yes no calories and the black cherry taste was tart and sweet but not overly sweet. Your taste buds adapt readily to the sucralose and it continues to be tasty and onto craveable tasty!!!!Some really good stuff next... they have no caffiene, instead, 50 mg of Green Tea and your metabolism is humming away. Wait there is more...B vitamins and what we all seem to be little low on these days D vitamins.  Of course...carbonation that is just right!!! While I love to drink plain cold water for many things, this is now one of my daily goto liquid libations from top secret aliens...:') Please don't let your lack of belief in aliens stop you from trying this very fine product.

  This is my first adventure in taste titillation with this gift of a thirst quenching, body nourishing, energy giving, refreshing, tasty, effervescent elixir whose formula I believe was given to the company by space aliens who did not want to see the American people suffer with overly sugary, caloric empty calorie brown bubbly water that has not even seen a cola nut. These ""Sparkling Ice"" refreshments that the benefactor aliens instructed the company to make have 0 yes no calories and the black cherry taste was tart and sweet but not overly sweet. Your taste buds adapt readily to the sucralose and it continues to be tasty and onto craveable tasty!!!!Some really good stuff next... they have no caffiene, instead, 50 mg of Green Tea and your metabolism is humming away. Wait there is more...B vitamins and what we all seem to be little low on these days D vitamins.  Of course...carbonation that is just right!!! While I love to drink plain cold water for many things, this is now one of my daily goto liquid libations from top secret aliens...:') Please don't let your lack of belief in aliens stop you from trying this very fine product. I am a Diet Coke nut. This comes close to my love for Diet Coke and will certainly help me stay better hydrated and rev up the old metabolism.

  I have now tried several flavors.  I like the Black Raspberry one best, a few are just OK and some leave a bad carbon aftertaste.  Everybody likes different flavors, so I won't assume you would like the same flavors I do.The flavor is stronger than most flavored waters I've tried.  I like this because with most flavored waters, you can barely taste any flavor.  I would really prefer the berry tastes to be there and the CO2 not to be, though.The other side of the CO2 levels in this, is it makes me start belching, during and after finishing a bottle.  It seems to be more CO2 than in the sodas I drank.There is a good quantity of liquid in each bottle so one bottle tends to go a little farther than a soda can would but a bit less than a Gatorade bottle.Because the bottles are made very slim and tall and with nonflat bases, they can easily tip over and spill.  Needs to have a flatter bottom and be shorter to hold the fluid without tipping over.  More like a Gatorade 20 oz bottle.I find several kinds of these have a strong after taste of carbon which I'm guessing is from the CO2.  Some flavors carbon taste were more noticable than others.I give these a slight recommendation for taste and a strong recommendation for healthiness as opposed to sodas.  I highly advise new purchasers buy a variety pack 1st, as I found judging by one flavor wasn't fair.  I have bought different flavors of these several times from Amazon and even locally when they stock it.

  I absolutely LOVE Sparkling ICE!!! Helps me to boost my H2O consumption, gives me a little flavor, and, because I get several ""flavors,"" some variety in my day!I have to choose my flavors for my own ""variety"" packs - everybody and their brother always put strawberry something or other in there. While the little scarlet death missiles won't kill me, they sure will make my GI system extremely uncomfortable. ICE uses natural flavors, so I choose the ones that don't have strawberry in there - Black Cherry, Cherry Limeade, Blueberry Pomegranate, Lemonade, Mango Orange, etc. And guess what? They are ALL delicious!!! My grandson even thinks they're wonderful - he didn't realize they were water until someone told him! This is the way to do it!

  Sparkling Ice, Ginger Lime Sparkling Water, with antioxidants and vitamins, Zero Sugar, is a new flavor of sparkling water from Sparkling Ice that is both delicious and refreshing. The main flavors, ginger, and lime are among my favorite flavors and I have found it to be the perfect drink during these hot summer months.Ginger is the predominate flavor with a good boost of lime and it really hits the spot. The sparkling water is fortified with vitamins and antioxidants and has zero calories - so no guilt. It comes in a pack of 12 - 17 FL OZ Bottles and is easy to store. Each bottle contains two servings but I must confess, I can polish off a whole bottle when I'm really thirsty in this heat. I am very pleased to have found this beverage and recommend it when you want something cold and tasty to drink. Give it a try.

  I absolutely love Ice water. I've always been an avid Dr. Pepper drinker (as are many of us coming from the mid- South). It's kind of an Oklahoma/Texas thing to do and so unhealthy.  My endocrinologist said that I was absolutely not to drink soda any longer due to the carbs. He told me to try  Perrier  to obtain that carbonation I craved but that wouldn't do it for me so I just cheated, telling myself there are worse habits that I could have. My friend turned me on to this Ice water but warned that she bought it by the crate at Sam's and felt it was probably rather costly. She was right. I did find it at Big Lots for $.75, each, however, it was burdensome to buy that way, and you could never be sure what was in. Now comes the Pandemic.  I'm Dr ordered to stay at home and have my groceries delivered.  I, personally, like the original flavors, which are the ones delivered here. This is the best price I have found. I can count on them being delivered to my door, packaged neatly in a tight plastic wrap that is in a perfect fit box. Sometimes, due to the carbonation, I worry about them spewing out of the bottle, the way sodas often do. It starts to fizz up when I turn the top, but always goes back down. I find that amazing in this heat that has been in the 100+°. Imagine  the temps it reaches  in those trucks. I am grateful for this water that's delivered safely to my door at a very reasonable price. Thank You.

  This stuff is crack. My boyfriend and I have tried every flavor of Sparkling Ice and this Strawberry Watermelon flavor definitely stands out. We've been ordering three 12-packs a month for at least the past two and a half years and we still aren't sick of it. It's the only soda or sparkling drink we drink. It manages to balance both flavors well, and it's guilt-free. It's relatively inexpensive, especially if you do Subscribe & Save as we do. You can easily stack the 12-packs on top of each other in a closet so they have a somewhat small footprint. Unrelated to the product, I also appreciate that all three arrive in one box that my poor postman lugs up a flight of stairs (don't worry, I tip him each year).

  This is the perfect sparkling & refreshing beverage.  It’s NOT the seltzer’s of the 80s This flavored sparkling water is addictive.  Be warned.  Pink Grapefruit is the perfect blend of sweet and tangy. The taste is so fresh..as if you picked the juiciest pink grapefruit, hand juiced it into a chilled glass, added ice  and a shot of fizz for the  perfect *sparkling* drink.  Just as the name suggests.  “Sparkling”There are no fizzing bubbles popping or bursting in your face when you take a sip.Think sparkling cider or a wine spritzer.  Also, there is no seltzer water taste with that salty bitter after taste.Sparkling Ice Is pure and natural..literally bursting with flavor precision. Each Sparkling Ice flavor tastes and smells the way the fruits of each flavor actually taste...the way a refreshing beverage should taste.I also love how the gorgeous pink color of pink grapefruit looks in my glass. It’s derived naturally from veggies  Nothing artificial.  And I most love the pink ribbon on the Pink Grapefruit bottles, depicting Sparkling Ice and Talking Rain’s yearly “Imagine A World Without Breast Cancer” campaign. KUDOs!It seems Some are confused by the *sugar free* ... this product does contain Sucralose.  It’s listed in the info, in the description, and can be read in the ingredients list in the photos.  There should be no surprise.  With flavored drinks, there usually is some type of sweetener. Even with juice drinks.  With this sweetener however, there is no artificial aftertaste.  That’s what sold me.  I’m not a fan of *sugar free* or *diet* sodas and do not drink them.  As I said, this drink is addictive... and it is the flavors that are addicting.  They also make excellent mixers for cocktails or mocktails & drinks.  Even better, kids enjoy all the flavors, too.  Great for keto and other dietary restrictive lifestyles as well.  I love them all but my top faves are pink grapefruit, pomegranate blueberry, black raspberry, crisp apple,  and lemonade.  I keep all flavors on hand though.  Now I’m going to have to get one just from writing about it.  :) Cheers!

  I think this is probably more about taste preference than the actual product itself. We love ICE drinks and keep them stocked in our fridge. Buying them in bulk is so convenient and shipping them to my front door is great. The coconut limeade was a flavor I haven't seen before in my local store and I took a chance because I love limeade. I feel like this was misleading because this drink is straight up coconut. Almost an overwhelming coconut flavor. Not what I was looking for, but I still love this brand and their product. I will continue being a customer... Just not of this particular flavor.

  I have been buying approx 5 or 6 cases of this product a month for close to 2 years.  But after I just purchased 6 cases (as the price was slightly lower) I find that they have changed their product with less juice.  It has gone from 3% to 1%.  What used to be a light yellow green in the bottle is now clear and the taste is horrible.  TalkingRain Beverage Company you have lost a customer.  If anyone figures something you can add to this latest batch to make it drinkable - please respond.

  Nothing to dislike here, I enjoyed every flavor in this variety pack. Wasn't sure if I'd like the Coconut Pineapple one, but it was a pleasant surprise, and new flavor for me. Pink Grapefruit, Peach Nectarine, and Kiwi Strawberry I think are my favorites in the Ice drinks, the lemonade one is good too! I have never been disappointed drinking them, no matter which one I grab of their many varieties. Not paid to say this, I like them and appreciate the lower pricing as opposed to how some of the others are getting too high for the amount you receive. Try these if you've never tasted them, and you like a fruit flavored carbonated drink, a good balance and tastier to me than any fruit seltzer drinks.

  I can usually get this locally, however, I live alone and on the 3rd floor..so when I saw this on sale, it was a no brainer for me to order it from here. Get a bunch at once, and not have to carry it up three flights of stairs..This is the best flavor in their entire line. If you freeze it for a little bit, when you open it, it turns to slush. Nothing better than a calorie free coconut pineapple slushie. This is by far my favorite drink and number one choice of beverages. It's not too sweet and does not taste like other low calorie flavored waters. Its yummy!

  I love Sparkling Ice Black Cherry and was buying it in the store individually all the time. I saw the 12 pack on Amazon and purchased it in June. I was very happy with it. This last order came by mail last week and when I opened the first bottle, it smelled a bit funny. When I drank it, it tasted sour, definitely not the way it usually tastes. I opened three more bottles and they all tasted ‘off.’ I contacted Amazon but was told it couldn’t be returned or refunded because the expiration date was still good. I went online and contacted the manufacturer using their form. That was last week and I have not heard from them. I’m very disappointed. I would love to send the product to them so they can check it. It is definitely spoiled. Now I won’t be able to order the subscription I had intended to get for the convenience of always having my favorite drink on hand. Had it tasted the way it should have, it would have been five stars.

  Purple Pack has no “filler flavors.” All are refreshingly delicious! Black Raspberry is my favorite but the Orange Mango (which I thought I would like least) is surprisingly good too. Carbonation stays fizzy even after opening, as they are too sweet for me to drink a bottle in one sitting. Price is even a little bit better than getting them at the Dollar Tree, and they are delivered to the door. Great “low calorie” treat, though definitely much sweeter (more like a soda) than flavored mineral water.

  It's rare where I'm from to find these on the shelves (Walmart, Dollar Store, Grocery store). and in my opinion it's the BEST one!  This flavor tastes like a Daquari.  Why it puts me in the mind of a banana one I'll never know as there's no banana flavor in it.  Just for the availability the price is worth it to have it sent and delivered.  But I DEFINITELY recommend this drink.  Try it! You will LOVE IT! I can go through a case of these in a week.

  This is actually my favorite flavor of Sparkling Ice.  However, the last five twelve packs that I've ordered have been undrinkable.  They appear to be left out in the sun.  The cap, instead of white, is a very stained yellow color.  There appears to be floaties in the bottom like the product is separating, and the clear bottle appears to have a yellow tint to it.  At first I thought we just got a bad batch, but they continued to come looking like this.  I know the formula was not changed, because I can still get these in the store without this problem.  I have ordered other flavors and have not had this issue, but this is my favorite and I won't be ordering them again.  I even waited a month to see if the problem cleared up, but today I received a pack that was no good yet again.  I am assuming the entire batch the warehouse has is bad.  Very disappointed.  I love Amazon and order many products and have never had any other quality issues until this.

  I subscribe to the clear lemon lime one because I HAVE to have clear liquids if I want anything with me at work and sometimes I get dud cases of this product.

  I subscribe to the clear lemon lime one because I HAVE to have clear liquids if I want anything with me at work and sometimes I get dud cases of this product.  The color is off (looks more like pond water) and the carbonation isn't quite right.  Taste is more or less right.

  Look at these pictures!  I buy 6 cases a month. As you can see, they are both the same product but are completely different looking and TASTING!!  The lighter colored product tastes like chemically altered colored water. DISGUSTING!!  I poured all of it out!  It also had only a 3 week expiration date!  I received it the end of December and the picture shows it expired 1/27/19!  The other product has a July date!  Come on!  Couldn’t your packers have seen that this didn’t even LOOK the same?  I had the cases stacked in my refrigerator room. It did not get that way here!  I am going to address this to the manufacturer as well!

  This is my 3rd purchase of this ICE drink. I learned about it while on Keto. The 5 calories and no sugar was a no brianer. I was instantly hooked. The coconut pineapple  became my  favorite.,i would sometimes add some real ginger juice i blended and it tasted like heaven lol. No issue with my first order ot second. However; i noticed SOMETHING awfully strange about this batch and you will see for yourself in the 3 photos i included in this review.It had me really concerned.  I wondered if this batch was counterfeit  as i saw similar reviews about that. My daughter said it tasted the same. She drank the orange flavored.  Ibdidnt notice a difference either in the coconut pineapple. But still, very alarming.ANYWAYS amazon did refund my money but still alarming like i said and now I'm afraid to order anything ingestible from amazon now. I wonder what happened? Why did it colored the bottle ? My first purchase would have given this juice a 4.5 -5 stars but this 3rd purchase is of serious concern warranting the low stars.

  I tried sparkling mineral water or plain sparkling water years and years ago and didn’t like.  However, recently I started drinking mineral water for upset stomach because it didn’t have the sugar, like ginger ale, which made me more nauseous when my stomach was upset.  I got use to it and decided to try flavored sparkling water.  I saw this brand while shopping a major retail out let and decided to try it. I chose this flavor and about five others. I absolutely love this flavor.  It taste like Jamaican ginger beer, which I’m not a fan of, but not as strong.  I usually freeze it just enough so it because almost slushy-like. I will be going back to retailer I originally found this at to try out some other flavors so I can have a variety and not get tired of the ginger lime flavor which I think taste crisp and refreshing.

  This is delicious, and with Subscribe and Save, I get to enjoy it, delivered straight to my door, for a little bit less than I can buy it locally; moreover, with Amazon, it's always available.  Because this cherry limeade flavor is frequently sold-out where we shop (especially during this pandemic), that's a very good thing.  I think Amazon has done an excellent job delivering during this trying time.  My only reservation about ordering this product this way is that it's heavy.  I'm disabled; a little weaker than average with balance issues.  I keep trying to get this shipped as one item per box, but, so far, it's only coming to me that way about every other order; so, if package weight is an issue for you, keep in mind that as good tasting as this no-calorie, delicious drink is, you may ""pay the price,"" figuratively speaking, hauling it from your drop off point to your refrigerator.  Twelve or twice that in bottles and cardboard is HEAVY.

  I was drinking these about 10 years ago. And I fell in love with this product. In the early 2010's this company really took off to a new level.After a few years of not having Sparkling Ice I tried it again. Something felt very off. And I tried multiple flavors too. It wasn't the same as it was during it's peak.  The taste seems unfamiliar.I honestly feel like they changed their formula 110 percent. It's still not horrible per say, but the flavor is not there.Case in point, In a world with plenty of diet beverage options, I personally  would not buy this product for a long time. There are simply just better options out there for me to drink.  These go for 90 cents or a dollar on average. You can get a better product for a fraction of the cost.I will be sure to update my review if I eventually give this product a try again.

  I found this flavor while in Florida, but couldn't find it anywhere back home. I remembered a family member talking about buying stuff that she knew she was going to use every month on Amazon. So I looked here and was so happy to find this flavor. We love it as is, but also use it as a sugar free mixer for cocktails. Mixed with vodka its a great low carb option to a copper mule. With coconut rum it pretty closely replicates a drink that we found on vacation that they called a tropical mule.

I found this drink had a perfect amount of lemon taste and tasted delicious cold; however, the only thing I did not like about it was the drink is carbonated.  I hope they come out with a NON-CARBONATED type in the future because it is a good tasting lemon water drink for a fair price.If you are seeking a zero calorie and low carb type of lemon drink you may want to check out this product.Rating: 4 Stars.

  This company did, indeed, change their formula for this drink; lowered it from 3% grapefruit juice to 1%--which caused a huge letdown in the taste and satisfaction level.  Wasn't sure if I wanted to keep buying it, but there's really nothing I like better, other than ice cold water.  So now I drink less of this, but when I do drink it, I add about an ounce or less of 100% grapefruit juice to it; that brings it back up to speed--and even better--than it originally was.  Definitely not convenient for the consumer, but then that's the new reality of this formerly favorite drink.  Water really is BETTER and less expensive for us.  But I don't drink alcohol, so I ""justify"" this little indulgence that way.

  The Good: Tastes like I'm drinking a Jolly Rancher.  Strong sweet taste.  Zero Sugar.The Bad: Tastes like I'm drinking a Jolly Rancher.  So after drinking mouth feels 'sticky' and you look for something to use to rinse.  So it isn't a thirst quencher.Overall: The % of fruit juice doesn't bother me as I chose this as a zero sugar drink and on that it delivers.  If you treat it as liquid candy (quench the sweet tooth) then it is OK. It is a bit strong/bold so I may try mixing it with carbonated water.  Flavor profile is good but I may not order again.

  I order this every week or two - as soon as I've put a new 12pk in the pantry, I order another one! Coconut Pineapple is really the only flavor of Sparkling Ice I really really like (there are a couple of others that are OK, but I prefer Coconut Pineapple) and it's impossible to find 12 packs of Coconut Pineapple in retail stores where I live. One of the two stores I primarily shop in no longer carries this flavor at all, and the other store never has all that many singles on hand, so it's wonderful to be able to buy this from Amazon. It's also much better than trying to buy and carry 10-12 single bottles at once like I was doing from the retail stores forever. As long as this is available here, I'll keep buying it regularly!

  I have been ordering Sparkling Ice Strawberry Lemonade for a couple years now. I am canceling my subscription because the quality has been very inconsistent lately.  why is the drink on the left (from Amazon) so much different than the drink on the right (from the grocery store)? The last order I received tasted like over-ripened (almost rancid) strawberries.  It almost seems as if they have been sitting on a shelf somewhere for a years, but of course there’s no expiration date on the bottle so there’s no way to know. I will just buy them from the grocery store from now on, where I can get them for pretty much the same price and at least I’ll know they will be fresh and taste good.

  This is hands down one of my favorite flavors! Sparkling Ice makes a really great tasting product! I have ordered these quote a few times and buy them regularly in my local supermarket! It's also a great product if you're trying to stop drinking soda because it's healthier (due to added vitamins, green tea extract, and no calories or sodium... and you don't get all the sugar, calories, caffeine associated with soda) and you still get that carbonated fizzy taste and feeling like you do with soda.

  Happy mouth! Happy mouth! Happy mouth!  It sounded delicious, and I couldn't wait till it arrived; for some reason it was delayed, which was mentioned in its posting.  But I had such a strong hunch it would be fabulous that I placed an order for a second case before the first one arrived.  And, oh, yes, it may be the yummiest one of all the Sparkling Ice beverages.  What's great about them is that they really serve as more than a beverage; they're as satisfying as any between-meal snack, perhaps because of the low carbonation and rich flavors.  What's really annoying about this one, though, is that my husband keeps finishing off my half-drunk bottles, which I put back in the frig to keep cold.  I can only cool two at a time because there are all those other flavors in there, and he's taken to drinking the one that's supposed to be his plus half of mine. I hate to be petty, but remember the one about Ross's sandwich? I'm going to start writing my name on the bottle with a big black Sharpie.  Anyway, I digress.... But, actually, nothing left to say except drink it and smile.

It has a delicious clean apple taste., without the sugar of apple juice or apple cider.  I particularly like this as a base for a cinnamon whiskey cocktail.

  I was looking for an alternative to my usual diet cola---this wasn't it. I usually like a fruit-flavored soda and I like apples, so I thought this would be a good match for me. It was not. It wasn't sweet at all. I don't have a problem with sucralose, the listed artificial sweetener. I tried adding some raspberry sugar-free drops, as I had used them on a flavored carbonated water product in the past. It didn't work for this. Something was unpleasant about the apple flavor. I like the canned Sparkling Ice + Caffeine products that I have tried, so I expected the same from this. Unfortunately, this was a waste of money for me as I cannot bring myself to drink them.

I like the canned Sparkling Ice + Caffeine products that I have tried, so I expected the same from this. Unfortunately, this was a waste of money for me as I cannot bring myself to drink them.

  I have bought numerous 12 packs(Strawberry Watermelon) from you over the past 6 months. In fact, last month I decided to go ahead and subscribe so I didn’t have to worry about running out. I’ve never had any issues, what so ever. However, this last order I ordered 2, 12 packs as I always do... and one of them is the new ones that have 5 calories in them and has a brighter hue  compared to the older version and the other 12 pack is the older ones that are no longer even sold in stores. With that being said... I waited a long time before I subscribed... and this is exactly why I don’t commit to things. Total disappointment.

  Got this on a whim thanks to a coupon and it (the Coconut Pineapple flavor) tasted much better than I thought it would! 17 oz. is a great size, it's fizzy but doesn't disagree with my stomach like a lot of other carbonated beverages do. Might just be a coincidence, but either way it's a good tasting drink and has 0 calories along with a small amount of vitamins.The downside is that it's sweetened with Suclarose, an artificial sweetener, which some people are against (generally myself included). Another downside is the fact that it has artificial colorings in it, such as Yellow #5 and #6 in this flavor (and, upon investigating other flavors, it's present there, too). Not a fan of added colors, especially when they're artificial like that. Hopefully they will go the way of Zevia and remove the artificial colors (and even natural colors) altogether. Regardless, the fact that it's 0 calorie and has a few vitamins probably balances out these negatives and make it a decent drink. I'm looking forward to trying other flavors of it.

  It actually tastes much better than I expect. Unlike diet coke,which I love a lot, it doesn’t have the sweetener taste, it taste like really sugar with zero calories. I gave four stars on presentation because it is pink color. I bought it because it is link, but it requires courage to actually drink a pink drink. I was used to black carbonate drink (coke) or clear drink (bubbly). Overall it is good. But I will recommend bubbly and Diet Coke over it.

  I love the delivery from Amazon!  I gave up drinking soda probably about 3 years ago (I cheat every now and then) but felt it was unhealthy for me.  I started drinking the Sparkling Ice Peach Nectarine, I absolutely love them.  The little sparkle and the flavor of Peach zero calories WONDERFUL!!!  Everyone in Maryland must drink these things because they are so hard to find.  As soon as I think I have found somewhere that stocks them on the regular they disappear.  They never disappear with Amazon and to order, pay and get them at the door is great!  Thanks Amazon for making life a little easier!

  This stuff has so much artificial sweetener that it reminds me of my grandmother making iced tea using the same amount of saccharin as one might use sugar. Any added flavoring has been overpowered by chemicals and it leaves a terrible aftertaste. It actually made me thirsty. I'm not convinced that it contains pineapple either.Make your own with better ingredients; try a splash of lemon or lime juice in water over crushed ice; if you want sweetness, add some honey, or maybe agave nectar. You can even use carbonated mineral water. Or, just buy coconut water. Amazon sells it too!

  I usually  order more than I need; and this time it was past the return date when I finally opened my last pack. I was very disappointed to find 12 bottles undrinkable.  I really love the taste and value of this flavor of ICE, but lesson learned, NEVER order more than 12 at a time or risk non-returnable bad product.  If not for the bad bottles I would give this 5 stars across the board

It is nice to get this on the doorstep, put some in the fridge, and prevent myself from mindlessly spending extra money on sodas when I leave the house--instead, I just grab one of these on the way out!.My favorite flavor is the mango orange colored one.

  I don’t drink pop or energy drinks & am not a big fan of plain water but, I’m not going to consume aspartame or sugar, either.  I tried one of these for the first time last summer and have had one everyday since.  They’re flavorful & healthy.  I’ve since developed my own method, though.  I use a 1/2 bottle with a 1/2 bottle of water.  I like a hint of taste, less carbonation, wanted to drink more water, AND it makes each on a 2 for 1 deal.  The bottles never leak, either.  The flavor choices are phenomenal, too!  Haven’t had one I didn’t like.

  I love the brand Sparkling ICE and the pink grapefruit flavor, but the last couple shipments, the coloring is so light and tastes weaker than what is in the store. I bought some new ones when I went to Walmart the coloring is completely different. The Walmart ones had a nice flavor as well. I find this with the ones I buy at Dollar General as well, the coloring and flavor is off.

  The fact that people on here are allowed to sell fake items under the guise of the real thing is wrong. On the road I discovered the ginger lime ice flavor. Loved it figured I would come home and hunt for it on Amazon since I have never seen it in my area. Looked forward to receiving it chilled it took my first taste it felt like I was literally drinking water. What I like to do with my ice drinks is take a can of club soda and make basically 2 drinks out of one ice drink because they are normally nice and strong. This is already so diluted you cannot. It is not the fact of only 1% juice the one from the store was 1%. I hate writing negative reviews but taking advantage of customers is just wrong.

  I had a product subscription for these but the last 3 cases I have received have not been good. As stated in the title, they tasted bad, lacking the pineapple-coconut flavor and tasting more like the carbonation than anything. The color was also off on all three cases. They looked more like the lemonade but the flavor was not that of the lemonade so they weren't just mislabeled. I went to the local Walmart and bought several from them and compared the color to make sure there wasn't a product color change in general. The Walmart bought ones were darker yellow and tasted perfectly fine. I have cancelled my subscription since this was the 3rd case and pantry items cannot be returned. Truly disappointed.

  I don't think its a coincidence that every time me or my girlfriend drink these we feel horrible. Then I looked up the ingredients which I will post below, I would stay away from this stuff.Sparkling ICE contains toxic ingredients, such as maltodextrin, food coloring, and an artificial sweetener. Food coloring has been linked to hyperactivity disorders, while maltodextrin can cause allergic reactions, weight gain, and bloating. Artificial sweeteners are attractive because they do not immediately affect blood sugar or contain calories, however, they have many adverse side effects. Sucralose, marketed under the brand name, Splenda, is the artificial sweetener used in Sparkling ICE beverages. It contains chlorine, a toxic chemical not intended for consumption. In small amounts chlorine is not harmful, as the kidneys, bowels, and liver are able to filter it out of the body. However, daily consumption can have severe consequences, such as cancer. Sucralose has been linked to blurred vision, Gastro-Intestinal (GI) tract problems, leaky gut, allergies, blood sugar spikes, increased hunger, and subsequent weight gain.

  If you are not use to drinking sparkling water, you may not like these with the first sip. I consider these drinks to be an acquired taste. They are not overly sweet and don't taste like a soda. I wasn't sure if I liked this sparkling water or not when I first tried it. By the second bottle, I was hooked. I love all things ginger. This does not have an overpowering ginger flavor...just enough to give the water a bit of taste. I started off with one case and just ordered two more. I'm hooked.

A chemical taste that is lacking from the store bought one I got days before this shipment. Don't know what's gone wrong, but something has. Don't think I can drink another bottle they are so bad. Really disappointing and a waste of money at this point. Something is definitely different between the Amazon ones, and the ones in store.

  I'm not sure if this flavor is in constant demand or very few people like it but it seems to be the most difficult to find in stores in large quantities. Nothing better than having your favorite delivered right to your door. Great taste without being overly sugary and a fantastic way to skirt the ""no soda"" rule with a good carbonated beverage.

  when i was a young boy my mom went crazy one summer preserving raspberry jams. our kitchen was overflowing and our deep freezers full of all things raspberries. i never thought id enjoy raspberries again. until one day i did. and then found myself becoming obsessed. so this water is perfect for me. the addition of the grape gives it a nice little kick. not the best price but doable. the packaging was crushed all to heck but was reinforced so the damage was minimal. all in all glad i tried them.

  I have been looking all over for the Crisp Apple Flavor Sparkling Ice for a long time. I have had it in the past several years ago and back then it was by far my favorite flavor. Then the stores stopped stocking it and I could not find it. Finally decided to look it up here and was so happy that I could buy some. The price is a little higher then the stores sell it in cases, but still cheaper then by the bottle. When it came I was so excited and ripped it open, got a glass of ice and started pouring. I was surprised by the carbonated foam that was appearing because it was thicker then I expected, with the consistency of the froth on a root beer float. I took a drink and it did not taste anything like it used to. I am crushed. This was my favorite flavor. Its not undrinkable but the Black Raspberry one is loads better.

  If you are able to order these where they come out to less than one dollar a bottle then go for it it’s a great deal. ICE is one of the better drinks on the market as far as flavored waters. My husband is quite addicted to them. They also make excellent mixers with vodka for martinis. We keep them in the fridge writer nonstop and love almost all of the flavors are favorites are kiwi strawberry, black cherry, tangerine peach, raspberry, and cherry limeade .

Good price and sooooo enjoyable.  You must try this if your like apple juice.  Even though the price is good but maybe you don't want to buy a whole case til u know it's good, go to the store and buy one, you won't be disappointed...For the price of a case, Amazon has the best that I have found.

  Excellent alternative to gjnger beer in a moscow mule. Save money and sugar and it tastes pretty good. Just use vodka and add fresh limes if you want but theres a lime flavor in the ginger. Not the same as a real strong ginger beer but if you're diabetic and want a mixed coctail;try it

I'm not opposed to any of them).17oz, so enough to refresh you.No calories or sugars... so healthier than sodas.Regular price is the same as our grocery store, but with subscribe and save... these are cheaper by $1.50 and count towards getting 15% off some higher dollar items.

  I love this drink. I usually get the black berry flavored one at my local convinience store, but as soon as I saw a variety pack on sale at the store, I wanted it. I checked Amazon first and found it cheaper here, so I ordered it. I'd never had any other flavor so this was an adventure. I even got my mom hooked on the peach flavored one. Piña Colada is my new favorite.They lightly sweetened with sucrolose (sweet'n low), which isn't really good for you but okay in moderation, and they're refreshing. You may get something you don't like (I'm lookin' at you, Black Cherry), but you can pawn them off on innocent, unsuspecting family and friends. 10/10 would buy again.

  I just wrote a more in depth review of these drinks under the flavor of Pomegranate/Blueberry,  but I will briefly do it again.  its flavored spring water with just a touch of carbonation,  its not soda water.  its spring water and then it has fruit mice flavors and no calories and it gets infused with some green tea extract and some B-complex.  I am amazed that these drinks are sugar free but they are and they are really tasty.  As a rule I like water or juice and do not buy into sugar free drinks,  but I do buy these and drink them -- my favorite three flavors are in order.  1. Orange Mango,  2. Black raspberry,  and 3. Kiwi strawberry.  with two others I will drink now and then the lemon lime and the Pomegranate Blue berry.  I have cases of each in my house.  great to give to kids too.  if you do not tell them, they will never guess its not full of sugar.  all the flavor is gotten from the fruit essences and a smattering sucralose -- splenda and I a small amount.  So if you are someone who does not like the sugar substitutes this one is still pretty good as it really is just enough to get rid of the unfufilling edge so many fruit flavored waters have.  But if you believe Splenda is the Devil than this may not be for you.  But I personally think that so long as someone is drinking plenty of water and green tea and being chill about other their coffee, their sugar, and other stuff. a little sucralose will not hurt you.  further more this drink is largely endorsed by a number of healthy eating websites as a nice soda pop replacement but I think that its more like flavored water that does not sit in your tummy like a brick as many do.  The one exception is that The black raspberry -- is almost like and old school soda pop but without the calories.  but I looked and in general it even uses a very small amount of sucralose.  the fancy formulation of this is ""Splenda"".  and so long as you do not stumble on a site selling a book talking about the evils of all sugar substitutes -- here is a balanced report on surcralose and gain remember its not the main ingredient in the drink,  it comes after the water and the fruits flavorings and eventually there is some sucralose.  here is a link for you [...] Bottom line this is a great drink for when you want a nice flavored water that is not too sugary tasting or too diet like tasting.  I would not drink tons of the stuff as a replacement for natural things but as a nice treat that one could drink several times a week,  I think its fine.  it is zero calorie and it has green tea and a nice vitamin B complex boost in it that you will not taste.  So until Splenda is proven to be really bad like say  aspartame,  I think its fine.  I am very picky about what I put in my body so I felt I should include this info here.  but I have cases of the stuff for guests to drink alone or to add with tea and ice and the love it and I have had no ill effects.  but I also drink a lot of other natural stuff or just good pure water.

  Around $10 for 12 bottles of ICE delivered is a steal!! They're usually around $1.29 each and if I were to buy 12 I would have to lug it into my car and then carry it upstairs. This flavor is my favorite flavor, it has a nice citrusy ginger flavor to it. I'm not sure if it was a bad batch or maybe came from a different warehouse but for some reason these taste a bit less tart than the ones I purchase at my local grocery store. Still delicious nonetheless, just a small inconsistency that I noticed.

I've read up on sucralose and most negative things people say about it are false. There has been 1 study that showed that mice had a decrease in good ""gut bacteria"" when given sucralose but there was no further research as of August 2019.

  These (and all their other flavors) are the best tasting substitute I have found for soda since starting Keto almost two years ago. The flavors are wonderful.

Also great tasting poured over a spoon or two of vanilla ice cream for a treat during the summer months. My favorite way to enjoy though is slowly poured over a large glass of ice. Yum!

This apple drink, on the other hand, tastes great! Fanta makes a good apple soda, but it's hard to find and they don't make a diet version. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys apple products, but don't want the added sugar or calories.

  I drink these every day, I try to watch my calorie intake since my heart attack 4yrs ago, before drinking these I drank sweet tea or soda and for the past 4yrs I drink these or tea with truvia .. These drinks are the best flavored out their, and have no bitter after taste, reasonable price.  I normally buy them from Wal-Mart however it is cheaper to buy them now from Amazon and delivery is free with Prime

Anyway, this is the second time I have received one of their flavors that tastes off kilter. Had it with a family dinner and no one could stand the taste…something very bad happened with this batch.

  Love this stuff. It's addictive. Especially in the summer. I've got my co-workers hooked. Tastes mainly like watermelon and it's best if you put it in the freezer for a while and make it slushy. Quenches thirst and contains more than a can of soda. I've capped mine, put it in the fridge overnight and gone back to it the next day and it's still fizzy. Pricey but worth it.

  I see some complaints about this only being 1% juice, and not 3%. So, I went directly to the Sparkling Ice web site. turns out, it's supposed to be 1% juice. All the bottles I have ever had, tasted delicious. (with the exception of some flavors that just did not appeal to me.)If you buy a flavor you have never had, and don't like how it tastes, you really have no right to complain about it tasting funny, or having a weird smell. Some of them taste funny to me, but, like I said, those are flavors I just didn't like.

  First of all, go to ANY store and you will NOT find a better price at $12.00 a dozen! Second of all, the product itself is great. Refreshing, and not too bad on the fizz factor. If you like lemonade drinks, try it. WARNING: if you want all natural, this isn't for you. It's got some chemicals that many like to shy away from (remember though, the air you breathe is bad for you too!) Like anything else, use in moderation.The BAD news, at least for me (and my wife) is that although it states caffeine free on the bottle, they all contain green tea extract. It does not state caffeine free green tea extract. Maybe it is implied, but this product definitely keeps us up at night if we drink it in the early evening hours. Your mileage may vary, but for us, it's a morning/afternoon drink only.But the taste and price makes it worth trying.

  I have been buying the same flavor for over a year. Probably over 100 cases so far. Recently, the vendor increased the price (not very nice since we are all dealing with tough economical times).  Though, my complaint is not about the price ! It's about the fact that past 4 cases that were delivered were basically water. Absolutely flat. Very disheartening to see price increase and this extend of quality drop from a trusted vendor.

There are very tasty and have enough carbonation to where it feels like I'm drinking a regular soda. I've tried some other flavors and they are good also but this one tastes the best to me. I look forward to drinking one of these everyday and I will definitely keep ordering these as I run out.

  I love the black raspberry however just got the black Cherry and it is EVERYTHING.  Sometimes Cherry flavors can get weird, tasting like cough medicine or like a lollipop from the doctor.  This to me tastes like the Cherry flavoring you get with an old fashioned soda where the Cherry flavoring is added to carbonated water or coke.  I think it would make an excellent addition to an old fashion or other cocktails as well.  Enjoy!

  There is nothing to dislike about these drinks. I wish they still came in the smaller aluminum cans as those are just right for one person. The bottles have enough for two or three persons. I like the fact these are shipped to my door. I like all of them - if I had to pick a favorite I doubt I could do it.  The taste is so delicious and I have recommended them to everyone I know. These are soooooo much better in flavor than any other brand I have tried.

  Probably up to personal opinion on which flavors are the best. I love the Pineapple, Peach, Black Cherry, Apple, and Lemonade. This is great stuff. Goes well in a glass of ice, or you can drink it straight from the bottle. I like it more with ice because it tastes more refreshing when it's colder.Price on Amazon is pretty great at $10 per 12 pack (anything much more than that and it's overpriced).

  I read through some of the reviews and I disagree with everything except the artificial sweetener. But that’s the trade off for good flavor. The coconut pineapple is a unique combo of flavors that work. I am a fan. I try to limit the amount of the artificially sweetened beverages but I’m not a fan of water. So it’s kind of a conundrum. So Sparkling Ice is a go-to for me. And I love this newer at least newer to me) flavor.

I opened my package today and thought the color was a little lighter than I remembered. Then I tasted it and NOPE!!! The flavor of the drink I purchased at the grocery store was like drinking a nice crisp apple. The one I tasted from Amazon had a funky flavor to it, tasted flat, barely apple-ish. So disgusted with this! It will cost too much to return so I am just dumping the lot and taking the hit.

  The Sparkling ICE brand is one of my favorite drink brands ever. I always thought I was craving sugar when I would reach for a soda instead of water (which wasn't often but often enough to make me hate myself for craving something so inherently unhealthy) but after realizing that it was the carbonation I was after, I quickly changed to these calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, and caffeine free) drinks instead. They are seriously so GOOD.And this lemonade flavor is by far my favorite. Many of the others are so strongly flavored (the pineapple one in particular) that you can't drink it with every type of meal (ie seafood, pasta, etc) which was annoying. This one though, I found I could. If I had to chose one drink that I had to drink for the rest of my life without ever having anything else, this would be a very close second behind water. It's THAT good.The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.Comment

  The flavor is good. They have several different flavors but Pink Grapefruit is so far my favorite. I like that ICE water is only 5 calories and no sugar. You get the fizziness that you get from soda but it’s not soda. The flavor almost reminds me of drinking the soda Squirt but I’ll pick ICE water over soda any day. I haven’t drank soda in over eight years. Awesome.

Really helps me with my soda craving. the carbonation is so good & the flavor doesn’t have that diet taste. was thrilled to look on here and see that they have my favorite flavor in one package instead of buying them all individually at my local grocery store. saves time and a few dollars cheaper as well. arrived quickly and packaged nicely.

  I was pleasantly surprised when I took my first sip! To me it tasted like an orange crush soda but and the pineapple flavor came through. Very delicious and refreshing drink. It is sweetened with sucralose that's what gives it the sweetness. I tend to stay away from sweeteners but will make an exception for this drink, it is that good. Everything in moderation 😁

  It's certainly different, I happen to like ginger so was very interested to try this.  At first I wasn't quite sure if I liked it or not but it certainly grew on me.  it's very refreshing, leaves a clean taste in the mouth and like most ""ginger"" products a warm feel in the tummy.  I did share it with a couple of friends who also ordered it and I am ordering more, It also goes very well with brandy. (I grew up in a pub in London)

  I've been a fan of this brand of sparkling water for a few years, and I thought that no other flavor could ever be as delicious as Black Raspberry.  That is, until I tried the Grape Raspberry.  It has the flavor of grape more than any other, and it is so refreshing and delicious.  My doctor told me that these are very good to drink because of the vitamin content and that they are sugar-free.  These drinks do not replace plain water if you are supposed  drink a lot of water in the case of kidney disease or if you need to keep urine fairly colorless and not so concentrated in order to avoid the  uric acid crystals of gout.  Otherwise, these are such a great drink and are a real treat.

  For those who read labels, this one is confusing. We specifically did NOT want caffeine.  It says no caffeine added. Then on the ingredients label, it states there is green tea extract. Unless they went through a very costly process of removing caffeine from the tea, it has caffeine.  If so, it ought to read decaf green tea extract. Deceptive? I think so.

  The case says, in bold letters, ""ZERO SUGARS"". I should have read the ingredients. I thought I was buying unsweetened seltzer with a little fruit juice. It contains sucralose. If you like sweet, I suppose It doesn't taste too bad, but I don't.  I feel the advertising should be changed to indicate that it is sweetened. I will not purchase again.

  At someone trying to watch the sugar in drinks I consume as well as occasionally getting tired of plain water. These are very nice substitutes for soda or even juice. Very refreshing and  strong natural fruit flavor. Black raspberry and kiwi strawberry are the absolute best. Has a bit of that ""diet"" taste but no where as bad as other beverages. Will definitely be picking this up again.

  The coconut-pineapple is so delicious and reminiscent of a pina colada. I purchased the variety package, which is nice, but I am ""hooked"" on the tropical flavor of the coconut-pineapple combination.  I have not tried it yet, but I imagine it would make a delicious beverage with a shot of vodka in a tall glass with lots of ice. I drink two full glasses a day of Sparkling ICE as my doctor told me to increase my fluids and it did not have to be just water. I am glad to oblige with this tasty, but not too sweet, beverage instead of the cola drinks I drank all my life. I strongly recommend the Sparkling ICE drinks in any flavor to provide to youngsters to break them of the Coke and Pepsi habit.  I would like to see the Sparkling ICE drinks  in vending machines..

  I have been drinking the kiwi strawberry sparkling ice for over a year now. I quit drinking energy drinks and made the move to a beverage with no caffeine. I've ordered off of Amazon on 5 separate occasions. This past time I ordered 2 cases (which I normally drink in 2 weeks). This time the color of the liquid was much lighter than the last and tasted flat and flavorless. Very upset about this and will probably move to another sparkling beverage now that the market is flooded with options. I will also be contacting Amazon to see about a refund for this tasteless ""flavored"" water.

  This is really great stuff--the taste is wonderful in many of the flavors (some don't appeal to me, but I do like the peach nectarine, the strawberry lemonade, the cherry lemonade, and the strawberry kiwi.  I noticed a boost of energy towards the end of the day (when I was drinking the product at my sister's house) and didn't realize that this drink contained a variety of vitamin B until I ordered it for myself.  Since I've been home, my son finds he loves the product, too.  I do have to add a little splenda to my drink (it makes it taste like the best fruit soda ever.)  Also--I especially love that it only has a tiny bit of carbonation--I am a gastric bypass patient and have to avoid heavy carbonation.  This drink has just a touch to make a little fizz the first time you open the bottle--it gives it just a little bite but that's all.  Love this stuff, but wish it was a little cheaper.

They had been slammed around so much all the carbonation was GONE. 4 of them actually exploded. So as far as the item ""Sparkling Ice?"" Delicious...buying in bulk to be delivered? Don't do it.

The 18 pack is sold @ Sam's Club as well but has gone up in price from $9.98 to $10.98 but still a great deal!) Tried it; loved it!

  Ok so I'm a big fan of these drinks, it was something I felt should be known.The flavor were as promised. And there was 3 of each. However, the look like somebody drank of off them. I later realised that it was the way they were packaged. As I drank it was a bit off like it kind of tastes weird, now the part that freaked me out was, when I finished drinking it left a weird coloring to the bottle almost like it was in there for a long time.

  I ordered these for a friend who was helping out, in putting in a big flower bed, and paving stones.  We are talking 14 hours in Central Florida weather in June.  He is not big on just water.  So I bought a case of SPARKLING ICE VARIETY PACK.  He is totally sold on them, and asked where did I get them.  He is like these are fantastic, and so was the price.

  I have been drinking Sparkling Ice for quite some time now. Seeing that I need to lay off the sugar this was a great substitute for a flavored drink. Buying the product at the store is great but honestly I only like a couple of flavors Peach being one of them. I would recommend giving this a try since it's no sugar and taste great!

  I ordered according to their recommend sizing. I'm a women's US 9.5.. They fit ok when standing but when you are off your feet you're left with a lot of extra space in the heel area where these can can slip off of your feet quite easily. If i went smaller they would be too tight and extremely uncomfortable in the toebox.

  This is SO good. The apple flavor is spot on - like freshly crushed apple cider! It isn't overpowering and the carbonation is thirst quenching! Great for in home use or to take along in the car, for a picnic or perfect for watching those outdoor team practices coming up this spring and summer! This has become my favorite no-calorie thirst quencher!

  The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free way of feeding those cravings.The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.The Lemon Lime flavor isn't one of my absolute favorites (that goes to 

Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

   and 

TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

  ) but it is delicious all the same. It's very reminiscent of Lemon Lime sodas but I think it's actually much better and much more refreshing.

  The product is great and I plan on ordering on a regular basis. What has ruined the delivery is the fact that we stayed in all day to receive it (as you cannot leave such items out in the Vegas sun), and yet the delivery driver left the item on the front porch in the sun! We were lucky to have found it in what we think will be enough time to cool the bottles. Thus, we consider the product fantastic, the idea of overnight delivery great and well thought out, but the delivery itself left wanting. It would have taken no extra time for the driver to have pressed the front door bell so that a flavored liquid was not left out in the second hottest city in the country. Those who order, beware that this could effect them as well.

  I love the Sparkling Ice drinks. Prior to purchasing Cherry, I had only tried Orange Mango.  I like Cherry, but it is just a little too sweet tasting.  I prefer Orange Mango. The Sparkling Ice drinks are $1.00 each at my grocery store and ordered from Amazon because price was at $1.00 per bottle or less on the 12 packs.

  The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free way of feeding those cravings.The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.The Kiwi Strawberry flavor isn't one of my absolute favorites (that goes to 

Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

   and 

TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

  ) but it is delicious all the same. It's probably the sweetest out of all the flavors though so when I have a bunch of flavors to choose from, I don't reach for it as often.

  These are zero calorie and absolutely delicious. If that is not enough reason already to drink them they also provide good source of vitamins. It has vitamin B3 and Biotin at 10% of the daily value per serving ( 2 servings per bottle so 20%) as well as 50mg of green tea extract which are all good for lowering cholesterol. It also contains several other B vitamins at the same value. I absolutely love these drinks and use them in place of soda.

  I recently discovered this at my local big-box store while searching for a different product.  It looked interesting, so I tossed a bottle into my shopping cart.I chilled it in the fridge for an hour, then took it out for a test drive.  As soon as I opened the bottle, I was impressed by how authentic the grapefruit aroma was.By the second or third sip, I was hooked.  This stuff is great!  Even though it only contains 3% juice, it has a very intense, very authentic pink grapefruit flavor.  The best way I can describe it is as follows: if you took some freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice and added some plain seltzer water to it, that's what Sparkling Ice Pink Grapefruit tastes like.Best of all: zero calories and zero carbs.The standard caveats regarding artificial sweeteners are sure to apply here, but it seems like this would be fine when enjoyed in moderation.  I wouldn't recommend chugging multiple bottles every day, but one a day shouldn't hurt.Amazon's price is actually better than the local big-box, and the Subscribe & Save option lowers the price even further.  Nice!

  The past several of these I’ve ordered (strawberry lemonade AND strawberry watermelon) were flat and bland tasting. I’ve had this flavor plenty of times, and it’s not supposed to taste like this and be flat. Newly opened bottles never even fizzed, and the expiration date on each bottle stated sometime in 2020. So, it’s not like the expiration date has hit. I don’t know if these aren’t stored in the right or appropriate area in the warehouse (too warm and/or baking in the sun) or what, but I will be sending these back for a refund and looking to purchase them elsewhere.It’s a crapshoot on the batch you’re going to get and for the past few orders, I’ve lost way more than I’ve won.

  I love the taste of peach -- cobbler, pie, ice cream, iced tea, etc.  So I saw this, read the reviews specifically for this flavor, and decided to give it a try.It's .... good.  Definitely taste the peach and nectarine.  Nice over ice on a hot day.  But I keep picking up another flavor:  watermelon!  Maybe it's just how my ""taster"" works, but there's definitely a strong flavor accent of watermelon when I drink this.It's not enough to deter me from drinking it -- but I have to say I was just a *bit* disappointed.  Would I purchase again?  Maybe.  Jury's still out.  If I stop thinking about it as ""peach/nectarine,"" and start thinking of it as ""fruit salad with peach, nectarine, and watermelon,"" I think I can get over it.

  I am a fan of sparkling water and this is one of my favorite sparkling waters. Sparkling Ice has a great product line, the water has Vitamin B3, B5, B6, B12 and D3. Plus it has zero calories. The taste is kind of soft drink like more than natural but it is naturally flavored according to Sparkling ICE. It is sweeter than other sparkling waters but it not overly sweet in my opinion. Amazon's price and being eligible for free shipping makes it a great deal. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because it goes flat too fast in my opinion. It is better if you drink the bottle in one sitting. It is  also sweetened with Splenda, if it were sweetened with a natural sweetener it would get 5 stars despite not being able to get through a Veronica Mars episode without my drink going flat.

  Update: I just bought the combo variety that unfortunately doesn't include the Coconut Pineapple in it for just under $10, because they raised this from $12 to over $20!!! (FYI: You can get 18 of the variety at Sam's Club for just under $11) I get so tired of & annoyed with sellers doing raising prices overnight, double and sometimes even triple the price. Ridiculous!!!  As far as the product: I love these Sparkling ICE drinks!  I have tried them all and like them all. (I don't much care for their lemonades.) The Coconut Pineapple is my favorite! A close second fave is Pink Grapefruit. They are both so so so yummy!

  I'm a middle aged sugar addict with a three soda a day habit. Since I want to avoid becoming diabetic, I've decided to stop drinking drinks containing sugar. I generally hate sugar free soft drinks but my wife bought this for me and it's almost literally the best soft drink I've ever had.The price on Amazon is high but.... this flavor isn't available locally so I can't really complain.If you like pineapple & coconut flavored drinks and don't want sugar then this is probably something you should consider.

  I guess so many other customers like this particular flavor put out by Sparkling ICE - that's the reason so many local stores are SOLD OUT!  The prominent ginger flavor, slightly hinting of lime, is a great taste and one of the best ""ginger ale"" offerings around!

  Sparkling Ice and vodka has been my official summer drink for the third summer now. I've tried other brands, but this one is the best. I typically buy the case at Costco, but I ran out and needed some for a party. My dad brought over a variety of flavors, including this Pomegranate BlueBerry flavor. WOW! It's the best one. I've tried them all....this one is it. I actually spent a little more money to buy a case of just this flavor. It's not overly sweet; but it is sweet enough to work well as a mixer. The fruit flavor is unique and delicious.

  good but flavors are bold and a tad too sweet but great as a mixer. I always open it and let it fizz out for a few minutes, if you do like alot of fizz it is great. A good summer flavor or drink mixer but a bit overwhelming as a drink on its own. Also packaging should be more eco-friendly!

  Strawberry Watermelon is my favorite Ice flavor. At $1 a bottle, it's a refreshing treat. Especially if You're watching your calories since it's calorie free.  I've seen it on sale at the grocery store for $11/12pack; but for one dollar more it's delivered to my front door. Love it!!!  Just pay attention to the prices because sometimes it fluctuates by a couple of dollars.

  I can't buy enough of these at Kroger's and HEB. The kiwi-strawberry and orange are my favorites out of the bunch. Sparking ICE drinks are great for us carbonation junkies but don't necessarily want to keep pumping 150+ calories, 30-40 g of sugar, and 60-80 mg of caffeine per soda can/bottle. There are some I don't like. The lemon-lime, lemonade and grapefruit don't taste very good but that's largely personal preference against those flavors. An added bonus are the trace amounts of vitamins and green tea extract you get per bottle. The best of all worlds when you need something carbonated, but don't want all the other garbage in sodas :). I've tried a ton of the zero calorie sodas and with the exception of Sprite Zero (which loses a significant amount of taste after a few sips), there's nothing quite like these Sparking Ice drinks.

No carbs, NO sodium, No fat, No calories... just things we like:  sparkling spring water with fruit concentrates for flavor, and vitamins.  Great prices from Amazon, too.

  Love Sparkling Ice's peach nectarine.  Indeed, all flavors are great.  Carbonation is mercifully light and flavors are spot-on.  My favorite bottled or canned beverages.  I recommend whatever flavors you like, with pink grapefruit a favorite.  Found that my sister's and brother's families all adopted Sparkling Ice, without knowing the others' preference for these beverages.  REMEMBER TO RECYCLE!

  I purchased the Pink Grapefruit flavor of this fizzy favorite and love it! It's terrific for a sugar soda alternative and yet the flavor is still strong and delicious. I love Fresca and other grapefruit sodas but I've started to get heartburn from them! Boo! This doesn't give me any issues, plus it's great any time of day being caffeine-free. I grab a couple bottles for work or as an evening treat. This is a pantry staple! I can't wait to try the other flavors!Try adding iced tea ice cubes for a new take on the half fruit/half tea drink. I do this at home in the evenings and love the flavor of it. I've only tried it with the pink grapefruit, of course, but I'm sure it's fabulous with strawberry lemonade and peach!

  This was a disappointing purchase. The carbonated waters were completely flat and did not taste right. This Amazon carrier clearly allowed them to freeze and thaw as this is the second flat case I’ve reveived and the water company explained that some carriers allow the product to freeze if not kept temperature controlled which completely compromises the quality of the product. I will not be ordering through this carrier again since I can’t trust the product will be in good condition.

  I have also been ordering this product for serveral months (same as Hitchcock) and have had the same observations.  The product that I received was very pale pink, not the almost ruby pink that the ""real""product is.  It also does not have the taste that it should.  Almost just like sparkling water without any flavor.  I don't know if it is a different product altogether but it seems as if it's been sitting on the shelf for months, even years.  I will not purchase it again unless I can get a guarantee that I will receive a product that is the legimate.

  These are good.  I love that they are zero calorie but have way more flavor than I ever imagined possible with no caloric load.  I have noticed that each shipment has bottles that are filled to different levels, even in the same packs of 12.  Sometimes there is a discrepancy of a couple of inches.  I'm not really sure what that's all about, because I don't see it with other bottled beverages and I don't see it in the bottles that I buy in person from the local grocery stores.  I only see it in the ones that come in from Amazon.  Also, the ones from Amazon seem to be considerably less carbonated.

I found that if I left my stash in the garage in the summer and if the temperature got much over 80 degrees outside my Peach Nectarine nectar would cork and be undrinkable. Just a word to the other ICE lovers, keep your ICE inside during the very cold months and the very hot months.

  I am so glad I stumbled upon this drink. I was browsing in the coupon section for the first time and clicked on a random drink. At the bottom (of recommended related products) I saw this brand. After clicking on it and reading all the reviews I ordered the Coconut Pineapple flavor. I got my box like a day later and put some in the fridge to get cold. When I took my first sip after coming from my workout I was totally blown away. This stuff tastes too good to be zero calories. There's not even an aftertaste which typically happens with zero calorie products. I have already reordered. This is a nice alternative to the Zevia sodas I buy time to time.

  This Peach Nectarine flavor is one of the truest peach flavored drinks I have had. It is carbonated but for me that makes them more refreshing.  This one has peach juice extract(3% juice) & green tea as well as added vitamins. The sweetener is sucralose.All of these drinks have extra vitamins added & depending on the flavor they most often have juice extracts for flavor.  They have zero calories

  I am addicted to this stuff. My Dr. turned me onto it as I was drinking huge amounts of seltzer water. This tastes great, has 0 calories and has vitamins and antioxidants. Is available in local stores but usually very limited in flavours, and costs more unless it is on sale. No brainer,  get exactly flavour you want, same as sale price in store, delivered to your door. Caveat, watch the price for different flavours as it can fluctuate wildly. Never figured out why. Seems to be a fairly common occurrence on Amazon on certain items.

  I've always loved lemon-lime soft drinks; so I'm always looking for new kinds to try.  I liked the name ""Sparkling Ice"" and the fact that it didn't contain suger.  When it was offered at a fairly low price, I decided to try it.It has been the closest drink I've found to a perfect lemon-lime drink!  It has a nice crisp lemon-lime flavor that is not overly sweet.  And it's very refreshing to drink.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes this flavor of drink which uses natural sweeteners instead of sugar.

  This is delicious as the sweetness of the cherries and tartness if limes combined with cold fizzy wonderfulness. I generally can only drink about 1\2 cup or so with diet sodas before they become too cloying but this stuff is good to the last drop and I am drinking it down without letting it get warm and stale as I usually do with diet sodas. Perhaps it is my equivalent of the Proustisn Madeleine as it transcripts me back to drinking Lime Rickey's at the soda fountain. This is the first flavor I've tried.

The color is lighter and the taste is different in the two cases of Strawberry Melon Ice delivered to my home.

  Orange mango is by far my favorite flavor.  It's not too sweet and not too tart.  Nice fruity flavor, and I still can't believe it's sparkling water.  Be aware that they do use artificial sweeteners in most of the flavors.  It isn't on the bottles, I found it on their website.  Zero calories is really great and lack of caffeine.  I started tasting lemon lime which I love, too, that my sister had in her fridge.  I checked out Amazon to see if they had it because I had trouble finding it in the grocery stores (I live in a small town and am not able to get out much).  I was so glad I found it on Amazon so I don't have to lug it around since it is delivered right to my door.  I've been trying other flavors too and have not been disappointed yet.  Still love orange mango best.

  I became addicted to these and now can't drink regular water. Buyer beware! Its addictive! I've tried every flavor but still, the pineapple is my favorite. Can't get easier than opening your front door to get your water. I used to buy them in the grocery but couldn't carry many and they were more expensive than Amazon.

  Delicious, bubbly and not too sweet.  If it weren't for these I wouldn't have been able to get off soda, it was ruining my teeth.  The alternative sugar used in this brand is not harmful to teeth and not addictive like sugar or corn syrup. I have two cases delivered every month, surprisingly it's even cheaper than cosco and it delivered to my house.

  Order these drinks on line by the case from Amazon because the grocery stores seem to have limited amounts of this flavor on their shelves.  This is my favorite flavor but I find it difficult to get from the stores in my area, even Wallmart has only limited supplies of the Coconut Pineapple and some Walmarts have none at all.  So I find it so much easier to order them by the case on line at Amazon.  They are the same price as in the stores and with free shipping it is a no brainer.  These drinks are the greatest - no calories, no artificial sugar or ingredients; and the fact that they are carbonated makes them thirst quenching.  Love these TalkingRain Sparkling Ice drinks.

It is carbonated water that has been flavored, so when you are cheating on your diet and need to taste something carbonated, this drink is perfect for it. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because after a while the lemon lime taste sort of goes away. I really can't taste either one. If you think this is going to be like Sprite you will be surely mistaken. Otherwise great drink! Get it!

  When you watch the purchase price and time it so it is cheaper than the grocery store, this is an excellent buy.  We have it on subscribe and save and I watch the price when the new shipment is up for delivery to check the price and decide whether or not to allow the delivery.

  Love all the flavors of this brand but noticed anytime we buy a set that has peach nectarine there is this “build up on the top or bottom of the bottle. I’m not sure what ingredient is separating but this is the only flavor that We’ve ever seen do this. We’ve bought just about every variety back and no other flavors do this

  This item is now being produced with inferior quality. The original Strawberry Lemonade actually tasted like strawberry lemonade. When I hold up the ""new"" with the ""old"" version of this product the difference is stark. The taste is significantly diminished. This company made a significant error when they changed this product. The ""new"" has little strawberry or lemonade flavoring. Very disappointing.

  this whole product line -- sparkling ICE mountain spring water is great -- pomegranate/blueberry is one of the more popular flavors and some peoples favorite but not the most popular one.  I would reccomend looking at all of their flavors - the mango/orange and the black cherry water are awesome.  One of the more healthy alternatives to water when you are drinking during the day and do not want water,  or tea,  or coffee,  and want to keep it calorie free.  -- I have found that none of these drinks sit in my stomach poorly as many flavored waters do.  -- plus all of these waters have some green tea extracts and Vitamin B complex in them.  great sweet drink when not going actual Juice.  I think of it as my healthy version of Soda.  but it is genuinely desirable and sits well in the body.

  I love Sparkling Ice, Crisp Apple.  I am a bariatric surgery patient and I have to drink a lot of water during the course of the day.  This fills the bill better than almost everything else that I have found.  I drink about 3 bottles a day toward my 80 ounces of water.  I don't particularly like the taste of regular water and/or bottled water.  I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't like the taste of regular water.  Although Sparkling Ice makes a number of flavors this is my top choice.

  This is my latest addiction.  I have a sweet tooth, but like so many of us I try to watch what I eat and drink.  I used to drink only plain water, but slipped back into soft drinks (Diet Pepsi - my vice).  In trying to avoid pop and get back to water, I started to drink ICE Strawberry Watermelon as a bridge.  It is so yummy!!  And for some reason this flavor is hard for me to find in grocery and mass stores in my area.  It's convenient to buy and cheaper on Amazon.

  Did the company that manufactures Sparkling ICE change the formula for the Kiwi Strawberry? Does anyone know or has anyone else noticed a change in color and taste? I use the subscribe feature and have for quite awhile for our monthly drink supply. However, this last shipment of Kiwi Strawberry is much darker in color and my son said that it doesn't taste the same. He says it actually taste pretty bad. I sure hope I don't have to send back (5) 12 packs of these drinks and pour one pack down the drain! Disappointed to say the least.

  I love this stuff and this is a practical way to purchase.  After drinking many flavors over the years, this one has become my favorite---and I'm not even a peach fan.  After 15 days on only ice chips once, I have a problem with water.  This at least gets me to drink more.  It's the reward I give myself for drinking more water from my filtered water.

  great brand, and one of my favorite flavors  Other flavors from kiwi strawberry to black cherry to pomegranate blueberry  are all unbelievably tasty and sit in the tummy well afterwords.  I personally have found a lot of calorie free flavored drinks actually sit in ones body like a rock or a mild poison.  the exception -- this brand  and it actually has green tee and b complex in it that you cannot taste but is good for you.  great healthy soda option.  oh and lemon lime is good but not as stunningly good at the other ones I mentioned earlier but taste is subjective  there is a mild carbonation to it,  but you can still drink it down and not feel like its tonic water.  just gives the flavor some flair.  still very thirst quenching

TWIST offered s variety for those of us who want & need real water but needed just a little extra flavoring to get it all in.

  This is the stuff the CTO of Microsoft Azure drinks.  I saw him taking swigs when being interviewed.  In MNTBHO he is one of the smartest computer people alive, and responsible for helping Microsoft resuscitate.  Anyway, the fizz is refreshing and the drink tastes excellent.  Enhanced with some vitamin and mineral supplements, I enjoy the drinks a lot.

  I thought that grapefruit was my favorite flavor until I tried this one.  It's so crisp and refreshing!I found it on an out-of-town trip. I'd never seen it locally and I was totally depressed because I thought I'd never get it again.  I'm not sure where the idea came from, but I decided to check Amazon, and to my amazement, they carried it.  With a Prime membership I paid less than $1 more for a case than I would pay for it here - and I didn't have to drag it home from the store.I'll definitely be buying this again!

  This is one of my favorite drinks. I was having trouble finding the strawberry lemonade  flavor in stock at the stores so decided to order it from Amazon.  As you can see from the picture, it is several shades lighter than the product we bought from Costco. Also taste very different from one another.  I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is a counterfeit product but it is not the same as those sold in stores.

Great flavors in the variety pack, but I do wish they would include all the flavors.In any case, they have no high-fructose corn syrup nor the artificial sweeteners that just make me sicker than a dog.  Sucralose (Splenda) is just peachy with me. And at approx. $.83 cents per bottle, they're approx. $.30 cheaper than at the grocery.Buy, enjoy!

  The other 3 members in my family like this better than I do. I like it, but I find it a little too sweet. I do, however, like to add some of this to my seltzer water and then it's just perfect and it lasts longer. The guys think it's a nice change from their typical go-to beverages.

  Very tasty drinks with 0 calories! This pack comes with 12 drinks and the flavors are (in order of my preference): black raspberry, kiwi-strawberry, pink grapefruit, and orange mango.I have purchased these at my local grocery store for about 1 1/2 years, they are $1 a piece when they are on sale so the Amazon price is pretty comparable. I order them on here now to save myself the trip to the grocery store. They are tightly sealed and do not lose carbonation during delivery. I'm sure they get shook up pretty well during transit but I haven't had any issues with them exploding, etc. I also buy the 12 apple sparkling ice drinks every month and be advised that (for some reason unknown to me) they do explode when trying to open so just make sure that you remove the cap very slowly.

  I am so thrilled that I found these. I'm always adding flavoring to my seltzers - and that's basically what this product is, seltzer with a whole lot of delicious flavoring. I don't have a favorite flavor - they're actually all delicious. Plus, I feel good about giving these to my kids in their lunch boxes. They taste best when they're really cold, so definitely try to chill before you drink them - and if you'll be in the car a while first I'd try to keep it in the freezer for an hour or so prior. If you're sick of downing diet soda after diet soda this is a really great alternative.

They have a great array of flavors that I've found are just sweet enough without being too sweet - like too many other drinks out there...I would highly recommend Sparkling Ice to those who also crave carbonated drinks (like me), or at least really enjoy them - this is way better tasting (and much less calories) than soda.

They have vitamins and best of all ZERO calories!!My kids, grandkids and I drink these instead of pop. BUT... I also use these as mixers for some cocktails and martinis instead of yucky tonic water or club soda or high calorie mixers like Seven-up or Sprite!! My favorite in this assortment is the cherry limeade with Barardi Limon or a Lemon or lime vodka!Another favorite is the watermelon strawberry flavor! These are less expensive than a lot of similar drinks, such a nice treat - drinking plain water all of the time gets boring and sometimes I need a little something fun and tasty to get my to increase my hydration!!I have these on the Amazon subscription so they come each month.. That lowers the cost each from 95 cents  to 80,6 cents each I really like these and highly recommend them especially on the free delivery subscription!!

  I drink these things like water when I visit my company's home office - they are refreshing and taste amazing. But... when I ordered here, from the bottles, they just didn't taste that good - at least not compared to the cans. Could be me, so strong rating, but points off for flavor cause the bottles just tasted weird...

  Like several other reviewers, we've been looking a long time for some kind of beverage to replace Coke in our house, and I can say we've definitely found a winner with Sparkling Ice. The taste is great, the carbonation is ideal, and it's a lot healthier than the sugary sodas. I typically haven't been a fan of flavored water in the past, but Ice hit the nail on the head. We've gladly switched and now have several great flavors to choose from.

  Don't like the bottom of the bottle. If you have a refrigerator with racks instead of shelves, they won't stand up, so they're always tipped over.

  They used to be green and taste good now they are pink and well don’t taste good. They say it’s not supposed to taste different but it does. I wish it was in my head but my kids won’t drink the new kiwi strawberry either.

  Sparkling ice is my weight loss secret.  Last August I eliminated diet sodas from my life, because even though they have no calories they increased my hunger and made it impossible to lose weight.  My stepmom got me hooked on sparkling ice and now I buy it by the case.  Love the taste and it has really worked to help me lose weight.

  I love most for the sparkling ice line with a few exceptions. This one is a must if you like peach flavor or peach soda. No calories and not too sweet, it has a little bit of tartness to it. I would recommend.

  I am very disappointed in this 12 pack of sparkling ice pink grapefruit drink.  It is obvious by the color that it is in fact an old and outdated product.  I’m not returning because I opened one bottle just to be sure the product is spoiled.  Generally, you send fresh products.

Especially this particular flavor.I hate the strong ""artificial sweetener"" taste in most diet drinks, and this flavor has almost none...  especially if you drink it very cold.The supermarkets around here are very  hit or miss as to whether or not it is in stock.  My favorite store offered specials on 10 for $10 but good luck finding 10 on the shelves.  For singles (when I could find them) it was $1.69 each.By ordering it here on Amazon, using the free shipping, it is way cheaper than buying at the store, and it's always ""in stock"".I'm so glad they offer it!!!!

  It is difficult to find a diet drink that is also healthy for you.  This product is delicious, healthy, and helps me to keep my weight under control too.  I love it over ice or straight from the bottle.  I always have it stashed in my purse when I go shopping for a little pick-me-up.  The Amazon price was the same as the on sale price at our local grocery store but the best part is that it was delivered right to my front door and shipping was included.  What a great way to buy a product that I use every day and now I don't even have to haul it home myself.  I'm a new Amazon shopper but I can't imagine shopping any other way now.

  We love that we save money by putting on auto delivery. We love the taste of this flavor and a number of the others as well. We love that it has just the right amount of fixz/bubbles so you aren't drinking plain flavored water, it's carbonated just the right amount.

I typically drink these a lot especially when I'm doing KETO! Also the ginger flavor is one of the best if you are a fan of ginger.

  I bought a three flavor case of Ice at Costco, but ended up liking the lemon lime the best.  I checked Amazon to see if I could get single flavor cases and was surprised to see that not only could I get single favors, there were lots of favors I had not seen before. The price is good and it gets delivered to my door.  I hate buying heavy items at Costco.  Lemon lime is still my favorite but the lemonade and pink grapefruit are also good .  I don't like orange mango and the raspberry is too sweet.  The lemon lime tastes like a margarita.

  Sparkling ice drinks are so good and a guilt free treat!  I love all of the flavors i have tried. I have never been able to find the coconut pineapple so haven't tried it.  I particularly like anything with mango flavor.There are only a few stores in my area that stock this and half the time, they are out of it. For a comparable price, I just order them from Amazon .  Be careful with the black raspberry and open it over the sink.  For some reason, this flavor in particular seems to be high pressure and I have had it squirt all over the place when opening even though it had not been shaken or moved prior.  I am assuming  it is because it is  a lovely shade of red on tan carpet.

  Signed up for automatic shipments for this one.  Our entire family loves the sparkling ice lemon lime and lemon/lemonade flavors.  Some of the other flavors are OK, but by far these two flavors are the best.  We enjoy these since they have zero calories but are still carbonated instead of drinking soda.  The price for this flavor was not bad either and is comparable or even a little cheaper than the local supermarket unless they are running a sale on them.  Having them shipped to the front door in 2 days and still in the packaging is a lot easier than lugging in the individual bottles and dealing with them rolling around all over the place as well.  This is one of the few bottled drink products on Amazon that is actually listed at a reasonable price, when compared to the local store prices.  I would guess the additional shipping cost are what forces prices up on other products.

  Awfully hooked!  Started drinking Sparkling ICE during a New York trip 8 months ago and can easily drink 2 or 3 a day.  Huge proponent of 60 oz of water a day, but have moved into Mio Fit water enhancer drops because I don't like the taste of water.  Problem with water enhancer is that the ice in my 24 oz water bottle melts and the water ends up tasting like colored water. I put 1 or 2 bottles of Sparlking ICE my handlebar bag (waterproof Ortlieb Handlebar bag) with some dry ice.  Thin bottles fit great inside the bag.  Lasts about 4 hours and tastes delicious!

  I am a person who drinks at least a gallon of water a day. I usually flavor my water with lemon or lime juice. I was looking for something different so I thought I’d give these a try. What a nice surprise. The flavors were so good & tasty. I’m not much of a “fizz” type of person, but that extra “pop” gave it a nice ending. Will buy again.

  This particular flavor is quite good but leaves me with a lingering thirsty feeling.  I would still call it better tasting than pop though and I don't have to deal with the extra calories or nasty sugar crash.  I would recommend that they shorten their bottle and reduces its thickness as it's rather hard to store.  It's almost a waste to carbonate it as well as it losses the carbonation within 45 minutes.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase.

  This is great tasting water. Of course, it's ridiculously expensive.However, I think the price is worth it if you're someone who drinks a lot of flavoured water. I've found other brands to replace what they take out in sugar, with sodium. This brand has neither. It's a great replacement for sugary drinks. I'd buy it again and would definitely recommend it.FYI - all the other flavours of this water are substantially cheaper if you're interested in the product but not the price!

  I've reviewed these flavors elsewhere. Have been a big Sparkling Ice fan since I discovered them a few years ago.  At first I wasn't going to order them because Kiwi Strawberry wasn't one of my favorites. I love the other three and wish they'd package them with Peach Nectarine or Apple but the Kiwi's sort of grown on me and the pack is well priced and saves a lot of shlepping.

  I am so in love with this water. My last order was for 12 cases. The flavor is just amazing and the carbonation is just enough that it satisfies my quench. I can't drink soda anymore so I needed something that tastes like a soda. This does it for me with less carbonation though but still is the best flavored water I have ever had. Love all the flavors but peach nectarine is by far the best of them all.

  This ICE beverage, is the ticket.  Flavorful, yet light.  I must have opened any given bottle as many as six or seven times, to take a sip --refrigerating, between-- and it maintained its sparkle, right to the end.Some folks have mentioned that the flavor was a little weak, but I don't find that to be the case.  I was getting Crystal Light Cherry/Pomegranate, and it proved to be over-powering, enough, that I decided to try something else.  I think I just might stick, with this.

  Good flavor and better for you than drinking soda.  I also like the fact that unlike some low calorie drinks it doesn't leave an after-taste. I would rather they used something a little more natural for the sweetener ,but overall if you're looking for an alternative to soda then you might want to give the Sparkling Ice a try.  So far I've only tried the coconut pineapple but am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors.

  While the product did taste exactly as it's described - pineapple with coconut - it was far too sweet for our taste. This extra sweetness is surprising in a zero-calorie drink. We decided to use our remaining bottles in mixed drinks at social events. We are fans, however, of the other flavors we tried, which had just the right amount of sweetness and bite. So, no need to avoid the entire ICE line - just, maybe, this one if you don't like super-sweet drinks.

  It's refreshing  and tingly joy. I add a few drops of liquid Stevia to sweeten it up. I use stevia with all the Sparkling Ice drinks. I like the screw on cap cause I don't have to drink all of it in one sitting. I order them a lot from Amazon cause they go quick in this house and it's cheaper this way. Also I don't have to carry them from the grocery store. Perfect. Plus it was cheaper a month ago than the other Sparkling ICE drinks. Oh well. Will have to buy less of this one.

No one ever asks me to sign unless it's a certified letter (which is always some type ""bad news"")

  I am an occasional fan of grapefruit, whether it be the fruit or the juice, and I found that this was a bit too tart for my tastes. Granted, grapefruit itself is tart and so the flavor makes sense but when I had every flavor of the Sparkling ICE line in my fridge, I found myself always reaching for one of the others (especially the 

Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

   and the 

TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

  ) instead.If you really enjoy grapefruit than I think that you will love this. It's just mild enough to mix well with the carbonation and like all of the Sparkling ICE line, it's calorie free so you can't go wrong with that.If you occasionally drink grapefruit juice but find it too tart sometimes, I'm not sure buying a 12 pack right away would be the best bet. I would try to find it in a local store first and buy just one to try as this is very dependent on personal tastes.Again, the ONLY reason this is rated four stars instead of five is simply due to personal taste. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they enjoy grapefruit :)

  Cold Sparkling water! Sitting in traffic listening to your a/c cough? Ice Cold Sparkling water cooling your throat while tasting the orange dance on your tonge, while it teases your thoughts of cold mango. Who cares about the a/c freezing up as frost flys out your vents. You gotta salsa going down in your mouth, with ICE Orange/Mango Sparkling Water.

  The Sparkling ICE brand is one of my favorite drink brands ever. I always thought I was craving sugar when I would reach for a soda instead of water (which wasn't often but often enough to make me hate myself for craving something so inherently unhealthy) but after realizing that it was the carbonation I was after, I quickly changed to these calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, and caffeine free) drinks instead. They are seriously so GOOD.And this pomegranate flavor is by far my favorite. Many of the others are so strongly flavored (the pineapple one in particular) that you can't drink it with every type of meal (ie seafood, pasta, etc) which was annoying. This one though, I found I could. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did seeing as how I'm not a huge fan of pomegranate but if I had to chose one drink that I had to drink for the rest of my life without ever having anything else, this would be a very close second behind water. It's THAT good.The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.

  This lemon-lime flavor of Sparkling Ice is truly refreshing. It's definitely a cut above the mainstream offerings like Sprite, Seven-up, Sierra Mist, and Mountain Dew. You sense that you're drinking a carbonated fruit juice product, rather than merely a typical soda-pop, which is primarily, artificially flavored. Unlike the lemonade flavor, this drink did not impart any detectable unpleasant or unusual aftertastes. Throw some of these in your cart...you won't regret it.

  Had subscription order for sparkling ice lemon lime.  Ordering was great (amazon packaging less so) but very convenient to have coming to the house on the regular.  Until Sparking Ice changed the formula, the color and the carbonization of the product and amazon said nothing, shipping the new product without warning.  It's now clear instead of lime green.  The taste is way more subtle.  The label ingredients/additives have changed.  And the product is substantially less fizzy.  Am canceling my subscribe-and-save.

  This tastes precisely like carbonated apple juice.  Appealing if you like apple juice; unappealing if you do not.Most of these Sparkling Ice products are combinations of fruit (e.g. kiwi strawberry), but as this one is not, one must ask if they truly wish to pay a buck a bottle for apple juice with fizz.  I, personally, will be buying apple juice at three-fourths the price and, frankly, the fizzy apple juice is truly not fantastic.

  This stuff has a bit of a citrus nip to it, and is perfect as an ""on the run"" drink in the morning. It perks me up without the use of caffeine, and honestly, it tastes better than any other soft drink or coffee I could come up with. The best part? Zero calories! Just beware...when they say ""Naturally flavored"" they are not talking about the sweetener. It's sucralose. Still, good stuff, and I am absolutely going through it by the case.

  The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free way of feeding those cravings.The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.The Coconut Pineapple flavor isn't one of my absolute favorites (that goes to 

Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

   and 

TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)

  ) but it is delicious all the same. My only complaint about this flavor is that it is so strong and overwhelming that I can't actually drink while eating anything. If I'm looking for something to toss in my purse while I'm out running errands, this one is great. But if I'm about to sit down for a meal, I have never once grabbed this flavor because it doesn't blend well with any sort of food I can think of. The other flavors tend to be milder and so they go better with different types of meals. Other than that, though, this is a fabulous drink.

  I am not a fan of drinking calories so this product is perfect for me. It has the bubbles like soda but doesn't taste like plain old seltzer water. The flavors are refreshing especially the citrus-y onces like Orange Mango and Grapefruit. personally I think the Coconut pineapple one smells like sun tan lotion but a ton of my friends love it. I drink more than one Sparkling ICE a day so it gets a bit expensive if you buy it in supermarkets.  I recommend buying it on Amazon for a relatively lower price

  Talking Rain Lemonade - even the name makes you think about thirst quenching, cool comfort and guilt-free (calories) lemonade !  With a slight effervescence, this bubbly, lightly (but fully) flavored lemon water is just the answer for a hot summer day as well as a bottled water that can easily replace my need for extra water for diet and after exercise.  Costing no more than any other plain water, this Talking Rain Lemonade is my number one ""go for"" drink !

  great beverage but I think that ice coconut is a bit rich for me -- but that is totally subjective.  Other flavors from mango, to black cherry to pomegranate blueberry  are all unbelievably tasty and sit in the tummy well afterwords.  I personally have found a lot of calorie free flavored drinks actually sit in ones body like a rock or a mild poison.  the exception -- this brand  and it actually has green tee and b complex in it that you cannot taste but is good for you.  great healthy soda option.

  I like this one so much I have it on subscription.  It's the first flavor I tried and the one that I liked on the first swallow.  It tastes very natural. My second favorite is the Lemon Lime, but the Black Raspberry and Coconut Pineapple are not bad. I will try the other flavors because the Sparkling Ice drinks are a nice change from non-carbonated flavored water. Since I don't drink sodas this is a nice treat. No calories is a major plus.

  This depends entirely on your likes and dislikes.  I think that if you like cider or sparkling cider, then you'll like this.  It has enough carbonation and a very strong apple flavor, so it is definitely ""crisp"".  We have this as a subscription, and it is very competitively priced compared to stores (if you can find it in stores)!

I have this product delivered thru Subscribe & Save even though it may be a few cents more than a grocery store that has it on sale - S&S saves on lifting loads of bottles and driving for something special to drink.  I hate plain water and need something with taste to it.  This is a great beverage.

  I am a huge fan of the sparkling ice product. I appreciate the fact that there is no sodium and only natural ingredients including vitamins are used. It also allows me to meet my liquid consumption while enjoying the various flavors. There is no after taste and really quenches your thirst on a hot day. I chose peach nectarine because these happen to be among my favorite fruits. The flavors are refreshing and I would recommend it to anyone concerned about sodium intake and weight. Sparkling ice is my go to drink after a workout. Try the different flavors . . .I'm sure you'll like them! I loooove it!PS: Even though the flavors are combined, you are able to distinguish the taste of the fruits used, i.e one flavor does not overtake the other. Interesting!

  My sister got me hooked on ICE.  I was always a diet coke drinker, but this is my new favorite drink.  It is so light, refreshing, pleasant.  Just the perfect amount of carbonation.  Not top sweet.  This flavor is really nice, but it comes in several others.  The lemon-lime is my favorite and the orange-mango is really good, too.  Coke tastes bitter and has a chemical flavor after I've been drinking these.  I only wish more places carried them.

  I love this sparkling beverage -- all four flavors. It's 17 ounces, so it can really quench your thirst for just over $1 a bottle. I have free Prime shipping so the weight isn't a factor. If you like fruit flavors, you'll probably like these. I took a chance on them and was really pleased.

What is so costly to put into it?If you hate going to the store and not finding the packs or can't lift heavy things then this is a great deal! The only thing I would say lower the cost to 50 cents so we who need is due to health or just want great water can buy more :) The 12 pack at 9.49 and it gets cheaper every time you buy it (now it was 10.00 for me) its a good deal but want it lowered

It seems to be little complaint but was ready to go on repeat order but not at 1.00 per bottle.  Seems rigged to trap you to buy again without looking at the price.  VERY UNHAPPY

  I never liked sugar free drinks of any kind for most of my life. But after being overweight for many years and also having high triglycerides for many years I decided to finally get serious about diet and exercise. I still didn't like sugar free drinks though, but I forced myself to only drink sugar-free drinks from that point on. One night, I picked up this drink called sparking ice and started drinking it in the car when I quickly stopped drinking it thinking to myself ""Oh no.... this is a sugar-based drink!"". I read the label again and realized it was indeed sugar-free. I couldn't believe it. This stuff is amazing! While there are a few flavors I'm not too found of, most of them are delicious! It does help to make sure they are nice and cold though. The cherry limeade and regular lemonade I find really delicious. Kudos to this company for making a drink I actually enjoy as much as or actually more than my old sugar-based beverages. As part of my efforts with diet and exercise, I went from 210 to 165 pounds and my triglycerides went from 300 to 150.

  I am not a big Sparkling water fan.. prefer flat until SPARKLING ICE Peach Nectarine.  It is very sweet and easy to go down.  NOT a big soda pop drinker, but like soda with pizza.. now I just drink one of these or one of the other fabulous flavors. Pink Grapefruit is AWESOME as well.

  From Amazon in the left.  Correct color on the right from Food Lion.  Already replaced once and came in the same condition.  These bottles must be very old.  Against our better judgement, we tried them anyway and they have a taste similar to mouthwash.  We buy this exact product all the time from Kroger and Food Lion and have never had an issue.

  Artificial sweeteners are not good for us, but I get tired of water!  With Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet) which is poison I stop breathing, but I seem to tolerate Splenda OK.

  I guess I'm just different.  It seems that many of my favorite products are no longer being stocked in my local stores.  There are many items of late, Coconut Pineapple Sparkling ICE being the latest.  I would buy it on sale - 10 bottles for 10 bux.  Then, it went away.  None of the chain supermarkets carry this flavor anymore.  So, Amazon to the rescue!  Not only can I get it. It is cheaper and now it's delivered to my door!

  I was an early fan of the Sparkling Ice beverages, particularly Pink Grapefruit and Orange Mango, and when I wanted something sweeter, Black Raspberry; I also love combining the Raspberry with either of the other two for a delicious fruit punch.  Not crazy about the Lemon Lime, except as a mixer with vodka, tequila, or gin for a low-cal cocktail. Kiwi Strawberry is kinda meh. Thought I maybe liked Pineapple Coconut but that only lasted a week; just not a fan of pineapple-flavored anything except for fresh pineapple--oh, and pina coladas!  So I've continued getting regular deliveries of the first three, for which my thirst has never slackened.  I've recommended them to all my friends and now they're signed up for deliveries too.  But I kept hoping for something new and wonderful to come out of this company and suddenly--voila!--two incredible additions: Lemonade, which tastes fresh-squeezed and, thankfully, nice and tart, not too sweet; and Peach Nectarine, which I'll review elsewhere.  Of course, it's all a matter of personal preference, but all I can say is: Try them, I think you'll love them.

  I am a big fan of the ICE products. The lemonade is one of my favorites. I have lost the desire to drink it on a regular basis, largely due to the artificial sugar tends to bother my digestion.

  This grapefruit flavored variety of Sparkling Ice is probably the best of this line of drinks. The pink grapefruit taste came right through, without being overly tart or sickly sweet. The carbonation level, as with all of these drinks, was just right. This is a very refreshing and thirst quenching beverage, and I hope that they never stop producing it. This one comes highly recommended!

  As I have said elsewhere after trying the variety pack, I love every flavor of this product.  These three flavors were not in the variety pack, so I had to order a case of each to try them.  It turns out that the review of apple saying it can be explosive is true.  After no problems with other flavors, an apple foamed over;  Just take care.

  The grapefruit flavor is a little too subtle for me.  I really like grapefruit and was hoping for something with a little more zing.  The 'sparkle' is also very subtle.  I wasn't looking for a soda fountain's level of bubbles, but to me, I couldn't tell the difference in sparkle between this and a glass of water.I wouldn't buy again

  As a major diet coke drinker I like to have something else in the house. Each flavor of Sparking ICE is excellent but my local stores insist that the lowest price is $1 each.  Not on Amazon!  Who now only delivers a 12 pack assortment with free shipping, but for less per bottle than I can get anywhere. Delighted!

  Can't hardly find this flavor in the stores... one store sells it and it is usually sold out.  The cherry limeade is so refreshing... I'm addicted to it!  It has just the right amount of sweet with a little tart.  I like to put a bottle in the freezer for about an hour as it gets really cold and a little slushy!  The strawberry watermelon is also good!

I have this flavor on auto delivery.The pink grapefruit is very nice and I have found not that strong but flavorful. I recommend these spring waters to anyone who is looking for a change from the norm. They have 3% juice in them. Thanks.

  So, this is my favorite sparkling water of all time. But I wouldn't recommend ordering it online if you can get it in store. They weren't as fizzy as the ones I get at the supermarket. Half the fun of sparkling water is that it's carbonated, so this really took away from an otherwise great product.

  I love TalkingRain Sparkling ICE drinks.  My supermarket stopped selling the Lemon Lime flavor, my favorite, so I was delighted to find it priced reasonably on Amazon.  The case arrived promptly at my doorstep -- a very easy way to purchase the item.  This flavor has excellent taste -- not too sweet but more flavorful than other flavored water products  -- and just sparkling -- not heavily carbonated.

  Mango is my favorite flavor. Love love love this. My sister got me into drinking this brand of sparkling water and have been hooked since. Sweet but doesn't leave you feeling heavy after drinking especially when you need the taste of something sugary without the sugar. So much better then grabbing a soda.

  This the best drink - I need some bubbles, not just lemonade!  I lost my sense of taste and smell over 2 years ago as a result of a severe traumatic brain injury.  The only “tastes” I have are salt, spicy and sour.  The lemonade is the only one I can taste, and it really makes me happy.  I order the 12-packs 4 at a time!

  I purchased this product because my two favorite flavors are coconut and pineapple. I have very much enjoyed 3 other flavors of this product but unfortunately, what was sent to me had hardly any carbonation in it. It tasted more like thin syrup than carbonated product. I did not want to have to send this back because the shipping costs for this were astronomical and cost a lot more than the 12 pack I purchased. I wanted to try this but no stores designated as ones that carried this product stocked this flavor, so I had to buy it this way if I wanted to try it. I will say that if this were properly carbonated, it would be a great tasting no calorie drink. However, since the company that sent this to me let it go flat I did not get the chance to experience that...

  I was a big diet soda drinker and wanted to get away from the aspartame that is in all diet drinks. I still like a carbonated beverage  though so the Ice gives me the no calories and no aspartame that I feel is harmful to us. The coconut pineapple is my favorite, it's like having a diet soda and adult beverage without all that is bad for you.

  All of the ""Sparkling ICE Spring Water"" flavors are delicious. Unfortunately, for medical reasons I have been told to curtail my use of anything carbonated, so I will probably not be purchasing them again. If you have no medical reason to avoid carbonated drinks, I thing you will find these very satisfying. They are large, so the price, to me, is reasonable.

Made with Splenda it doesn't have any nasty aftertaste and the added B vitamins are a definate bonus.  Chill it and its nice and refreshing in this hot weather.  Tastes more of more pineapple than coconut to me.  Love it so much I've subscribed to a regular delivery from Amazon ... can't beat that :)

  There are plenty of flavored bottled waters out there. Some may have the same virtues as Sparkling Ice. No calories, fat, sugar, carbs. Basically nothing bad. I have had others but none have tasted as great as this brand so I'm done testing. Sparkling Ice does use mountain spring water which is not common from what I've seen.

I really enjoy this product and drink it at room temperature and when cold.  Good taste, non filling and quenches ones thirst.

  You might have seen my reviews on three ICE flavors. This one is good. It has less bite than the pink grapefruit, but it's not overly sweet like the pineapple and coconut. I'd consider it a light taste, in the middle of the grapefruit and pineapple. There's no ""diet drink"" aftertaste with this flavor, either. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, like sugar, with the ICE drinks.

  The 'Pink Grapefruit' is by far my favorite of these flavored ICE waters.  I also enjoy the Strawberry Lemonade flavor.  These are carbonated waters (fizzy). so if you prefer 'flat' water, these are not for you.  I typically prefer the flat waters myself (especially HINT Lime and HINT Blackberry flavors), however once in awhile I change it up with this.

  Sparkling ICE Spring Water, Kiwi Strawberry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)  These come less than $1 a bottle to my door; no dragging them in a car and grocery cart!  My 21 year old daughter had the last bottle while working in a hot foundry and told me it was wonderful to drink this flavor during her break, so I ordered more today. All the Sparkling ICE I have bought taste delicious, but she likes this flavor the most. I think the bottle shape and size is perfect and hope that they do not try to improve anything.

  Not too tart, not too sweet, not too much carbonation - just right!  Everyone is intrigued by the bottle itself when they see it and then after a taste, they're a fan.  I purchase 18 pack from Sam's (orange mango, black raspberry, lemon lime), finding the pink grapefruit is hit or miss and I've only been able to find in singles; so I have a case auto shipped - it's less expensive and reliable.

Everyone in my house liked it. Very good alternative to soda - with at least some mineral benefit. My favorite is the Lemon Lime. Excellent flavor. A little pricier than regular bottled water but worth the cost in my opinion.

  This is my favorite flavor of Ice and seldom available in stores around here so I enjoy the Subscribe & Save option on this. The flavor it good on its own or when used with Diet Ginger Ale or Squirt for a cocktail type drink. It is also good with frozen fruit blended into a smoothie type beverage.

  Love these drinks!  Only complaints are that Costco doesn't sell them anymore(Walmart does) and that the base of the container makes it easier to tip over than other wider based drinks.  Costco make a Kirkland knock off version but it's not nearly as good.  Zero calories

I can't believe there's no calories, sodium, and etc in this drink because it taste so good.  I decided to give these a try to curve my soda craving and it worked.  You will not be disappointed and the price is pretty fair as well.

  I am not a fan of the other flavors, but I love the grapefruit one.  I drink these all of the time in place of diet soda.  This flavor has the least noticable sweetener aftertaste in my opinion.

  I chose this rating because it signifies the joys of summer breeze with a nice drink in hand. I like the great fizz that comes with this drink. I would recommend this drink in combination with a soda pop in your other hand, preferably a Sprite or other Cola-ed soft drink with a fizz and effervescence in it.

  Tired of the 3 flavors offered at Costco. Shipping cost was outrageous, so I elected to wait 2 months for free shipping (really) and then I received notice  that my items would arrive sooner. Waited maybe 10 days. These flavors are a little more expensive but a nice change. I love these since giving up diet coke 6 months ago.

  I love all the flavors of these! Very tasty and no calories, no weird artificial flavor aftertaste. Great for low-calorie alcoholic drink mixers on a diet, or just a great alternative to soda and high-calorie sugar-filled juices. The amazon prime price is cheaper than the supermarket for most flavors. No complaints!

  Sparkling Ice has mastered the flavored water drink.  This is especially true in regards to the peach nectarine variety.  It is so flavorful and really tastes like peaches and nectarines.  I like this as an alternative to diet soda.  If you want something that's got the fizz of soda, the calories of diet soda and is essentially sparkling water with amazing flavor - this drink is what you're looking for.  Out of all the flavors that Sparkling Ice offers, this one is by far my favorite.  My kids love it too!

  I don't care for plain water but these have increased my consumption greatly. Flavorful with a little fizz. And less expensive than purchasing individually at the grocery store.

  If you like apple juice, but not the calories and carbs, you will love this lightly carbonated apple flavored water. It has a crisp taste, but no syrupy residue on your lips. Do yourself a favor and try some - especially for the autumn season.

  I like them very much -- so much so that I drink them almost all day, which helps me flush out my system. I'm a longtime Diet Coke addict and have been weaning myself off of it slowly because of the headaches. These are great-tasting, they're carbonated, I love the fizz, and yes, they have sucralose (Splenda), but Bai has Stevia (which causes stomach irritation to many) and VitaminFizz also has sucralose as well as Erythritol,  Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, and Cyanocobalamin -- there are vitamins in Sparkling ICE, and I've looked around enough to settle on these. Just wish they weren't so expensive, or I'd give them 5 stars.

As I was walking down the grocery aisle, I ran across these and grabbed one to give it a try... that was all it took. I immediately ordered more online. I love the level of fizziness these drinks have and their taste is unrivaled. It gives you the carbonation of soda without all of the unhealthiness. I absolutely love the black raspberry flavor. The only flavor that was kind of questionable to me was the kiwi strawberry; it tasted slightly 'chemically' to me. Other than that, I am very happy with these drinks and have found my alternative to soda. I plan on trying all of he flavors that I can find and may possibly set up a subscription for these.Overall, these are fantastic drinks. My friends and family have tried them and enjoyed them as well. The main comment that everyone has is the surprisingly refreshing carbonation that they have. Just as an added side note, they are much better chilled than warm. I recommend sticking them in the fridge before drinking; it improves the experience ten-fold.

  My first time buying this was at a local grocery store. They were on sale 10/$10.00. I have been hooked every since.  What a wonderful drink to have, especially when it is cold.  This is a refreshing drink to have in the summer during one of those hot days.  I thoroughly enjoy it.  One of my favorite flavors.  Now if they would only make a peach flavor.

I searched for an hour looking on the bottle for what it was..and was such tiny print, I never did find it until my 4th bottle. THERE HIDDEN AT THE VERY BOTTOM:: 'sweetened by Splenda'.....I do not like any fake sweetners. They ruin a drink and do not do well with my own body chemistry. I do not feel they are safe IMO. They leave an after taste and now I'm stuck with all these drinks. PLEASE PUT THIS IN THE MAIN BODY OF THE DESCRIPTION. I'm going back to my seltzer water........much better/healthier!!!!

  Uncovered Sparkling Ice on a trip to California with my daughter last July!  It is the answer to a healthy drink with absolutely no calories and just enough flavor to make spring water interesting without being overly sweet, plus a little fizz which I love!  Enjoy being able to order it by the case from Amazon!!

  Way too sweet and heavily flavored for me but I started breaking them down with just plain sparkling water and... magic. Most people would probably like these as is... they basically are just sugar free fruit soda. I find them way too sweet and strong on their own but the flavors are good and I like them once they are watered down a bit. Would buy again. Also the carbonation in these lasts a long time, I can close the bottle back up and the next day it still has bubbles. Brilliant.

  My very favorite flavor, and it is delicious tasting, is Kiwi Strawberry.  Pink Grapefruit is OK.  The flavor I don't like is Black Raspberry. However I don't drink it too often.  I should give Sparkling Ice Spring Waters no more than 1 star because of the one potentially dangerous ingredient SUCRALOSE.  It's a calorie-free sugar substitute, think Splenda (aka sucralose). ""But ingesting sucralose could cause more damage than people think.These compounds have been linked to birth defects, cancer, and immune dysfunction. These chemicals stay in the body and accumulate over time. According to the Sucralose Toxicity Information Center, the absorbed sucralose and its chemically altered substances concentrate in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract.  In many scientists opinion, not enough long-term research has been conducted on sucralose to establish its safety for human consumption.""

  I'm really happy with this Sparkling Ice water. The orange mango has a nice flavor, light carbonation, and it's not as sweet as Vitamin Water. Per bottle, you get 20% of your daily B-vitamins, Vitamin D, and Biotin. There's also green tea extract that adds a little antioxidant.I like the bottle, too. It's 17 oz, but it's a longer, thinner bottle than Gatorade or Vitamin Water. So, for my small hands, it's easier to hold. That might be a silly thing to share in my review. But I think ergonomics do matter!Overall, this is a very good product. And the shipping from Amazon was very fast. I'm looking forward to trying the other Ice flavors.

You can get cases of assorted flavors at BJs or SAMs but I don't like all of the included flavors.

  My daughter started drinking this product to help with hydration and quitting soda. Unfortunately she has been drinking this since May 2014, and I believe it is directly connected to her mysterious illness. She has been ill since the end of May, doctors thought it was mono, multiple blood tests says not mono. Then doctors said it's dehydration, but she has been drinking 15 to 17 bottles a week plus the occasional bottled water mom forces on her. She has been running a low grade fever, sleeping 16 to 18 hours a day, regular dizziness, and recently in the past week she started vomiting. We just realized that she had been sick since she started drinking this stuff today, October 8, 2014. It was the only thing that had changed in her diet. Just got off the phone with the doc, he said stop the Sparkling Ice!An added note, our last case of the coconut pineapple was disgusting, it resembled skunked beer...definitely a quality control problem.

  Wow! Where have these things been at all my life? This is a really great alternative to soda and the loads of sugar and empty calories that go along with it. We tried these along with the Kirkland brand from Costco. I didn't notice too much of a difference between the two, just that the Costco ones are a bit more colorful and have a slightly more heavier taste. Going back to the Sparking Ice, thus far my favorite flavor has been the black raspberry. Add some ice cubes, pour the beverage and good to go!We also bought little popsicle makers and poured this in them, man they came out good! The Strawberry Kiwi was probably my favorite in a Popsicle form.Visit examinators.com for more awesome reviews

  Can't say enough good things about the water. However, I've noticed most people either love it or hate it and if they hate it, it's due to the carbonation and after drinking it a couple times, they love it. I drink 3-4 of these per day and hope they never stop selling them. Got me totally off sodas.

  ICE drinks taste very good, and there are so many different flavors. Drinking ICE is a much better alternative to drinking soda. If you go into warehouse deals at Amazon, you can find 12 packs of ICE even cheaper than the dollar per bottle price.

  After running around the stores looking for these ICE coconut/pineapple drinks...I just gave up on them.....the stores had a lot of other flavors, but the Coco/Pine is my favorite.  My daughter checked the Amazon lists, and saw that I could get them DELIVERED!!  I was so surprised! Who'd think about mailing 3 cartons of drinks?  They came today, which was earlier than than I was told they'd get here...all in good shape....not a one leaked, or burst! :)  I've taken out an automatic delivery on these, and I'm just doing a dance, I'm so happy! Thanks very much for the great service!!

  Great drink, attrocious prices...These are by far my favorite thing to drink. They are refreshing, zero cal, mix well with other drinks ;), and most of the flavors taste really great. However, something has happened recently to the stock on Amazon, and the prices of the ones I enjoy have shot through the roof, nearly doubling from the $12 for 12 price-point that they were originally sold at. Maybe its the cost of shipping water (weight-wise, that's always made water difficult to buy unless you do so in bulk). You can still buy them at most of your local grocery markets or gas stations at around $1/bottle, but not so here on Amazon. I recommend finding them locally until the price comes back down here.

  This is a very pleasant tasting drink, but my concern is that it comes with the artificial sweetener Sucralose. Many studies have shown that Sucralose, a widely used sweetening agent is bad for your body. In addition, it leaves the product with an ever so slight aftertaste. The upside to Sucralose is that it's very inexpensive, thus the cost for this drink is low.If you want to spend the extra bucks on a naturally flavored carbonated drink, I highly recommend Bai5 Bubbles. It's made with Erythritol, which leaves absolutely no aftertaste and is good for you to boot.

  Normally buy from the store but they never carry my favorite flavor. Decided to try the subscribe and save so I bought two 12 packs. Both 12 packs are flat. I can't figure out if it is a manufacturer defect or that they have been sitting too long on the shelf. I have bought flat Ices from the grocery store as well. They might use the same distributor or they are using the same bad batch. Either way, someone needs to address the quality control issue with this product. It's hard to believe that two sources would both have old product which leads me to believe that it may be the fault of the manufacturer. I will try one more shipment from the subscribe and save. If that is flat I will go back to taking my chances at the grocery store; at least with the sore there is a greater probability of buying a fresher batch. I love the Ice drinks when they are fizzy, it counteracts the sweet flavor. But without the fizz, it is less than satisfactory and that is why I gave it one star.

  I like this sparkling soda.  Of all the variety of flavors the lemonade is the one I like and the only one I drink since I first tasted it.  I mix the Sparkling Ice Lemonade with my own homemade Lemonade Iced Tea and a little seltzer.  I drink this year round.  I live in New York City without a car.  Sparkling Ice is not always available in the stores (and the Lemonade is not always in stock).  A recurring deliver of the Sparkling Ice Lemonade assures that I will have some when I want it.  Thank you Amazon.

  I thought that I had found the perfect summer drink with my favorite flavors, but I was so wrong.  We ordered a case of these drinks and I drank them even though they had a medicinal taste.  They do have a lot of carbonation, probably too much.  They do contain water but the flavors are very weak for a fruit flavored drink.  They are not sweet at all and they don't taste like the fruits on the labels either. They tasted like very, very diluted fruit juice blends, with the artificial sweetener after taste which remained a long time after the juice left the mouth.  Reminded me of the old Diet Soda Tab and Sprite flavors.  No taste with no calories.

  All I can say is YUMMY!! Low on carbs and very refreshing when served cold in the summer. Everyone seems to love this drink when I serve it and they all want more. Unfortunately the price on these has gone up almost double from November '15 to mid-January '16 while other flavors of the same drink didn't have a price change, Amazon- this Sux! In a big Sucky way & it's totally lame you almost doubled the cost of the more popular flavors. Like you don't make enough money already you greedy McGreedysons! Can anyone say bourgeois SOB's!!!

  All I can say is YUMMY!! Low on carbs and very refreshing when served cold in the summer. Everyone seems to love this drink when I serve it and they all want more. Unfortunately the price on these has gone up almost double from November '15 to mid-January '16 while other flavors of the same drink didn't have a price change, Amazon- this Sux! In a big Sucky way & it's totally lame you almost doubled the cost of the more popular flavors. Like you don't make enough money already you greedy McGreedysons! Can anyone say bourgeois SOB's!!!

  Delightful, full flavored, no calorie, carbonated beverage with a tropical taste. Great mixed with liquor or served alone with ice. There is no artificial flavor after taste. The bottles can be opened, then re-closed and stay fresh and bubbly in the fridge for days. This is a refreshing change from the usual cola and lemon lime beverage flavors.

  Diabetics Beware! These ""sugar free"" drinks made my blood sugar spike dangerously high. I bought many of the delicious Sparkling Ice flavors, and drank them freely for several months... until a bad A1c report from my doctor caused me to start testing my BS more frequently and I found that drinking just half a bottle of this ""zero carb"" soda raised my BS up from 140 to over 260! Of course your results may vary (I have other medical conditions that could be contributing factors) but I would urge all diabetics to check with their doctor about testing their BS before, and a few hours after drinking this, or any other new products they add to their diet that claim to be ""zero carb"" or ""sugar free"" as I have a similar problem with some sugar alcohols that claim to be diabetic friendly.Sorry Sparkling Ice, but I'll no longer be purchasing your sucralose sweetened products... I hope you will consider reformulating with a safer sweetener because I really do love many things about your product... with delicious flavors, added vitamins and antioxidants, I found it to be a very hydrating, satisfying beverage.

  If you are a soda lover but don't want to drink soda or diet soda this is definitely the way to go. They have a huge variety of flavors and all of them are great. This is a very light drink and the carbonation gives you what you need as far as wanting a soda type drink.  There are very few if any calories in this, and the taste is not taste like your typical diet drink. I like to throw my refrigerated bottles in the freezer for about  30 minutes and then when I go to open it it becomes an instant slushy. These are divine. In my opinion the very best flavor made is the coconut pineapple, second would be the lime. You will not be disappointed with this drink it is fabulous

  The first order of these was good and I really liked it (the product usually is fantastic tasting), so I purchased two more of these, along with an orange mango flavor.  The orange is fine, but both of the Prom/blueberry cases are almost completely flat.  Disappointing.  To be sure, I went to the supermarket and picked some up, and I have verified that there is a HUGE difference.  I went here online and requested to return them, and I got a refund.  Amazon Customer Service is the best.Update:  I tried ordering it again, ~6months later, and what I got was completely flat.  I love this stuff when it's carbonated, but flat it's horrible.  Disappointed again.  Fortunately Amazon's great CS refunded my money, but I would think if it was flat they'd stop selling it until they got a better quality supply.

  Let me say I love Sparkling Ice flavored water. I am enjoying trying all the flavors, and they are all a refreshing and tasty way to drink your water. The pomegranate is not as flavorful as some of the others, its a little weak tasting to my family and I. Its not bad, but if you closed your eyes, you'd never guess what this flavor was. My daughter said it tastes ""pink"" and that about describes it. I recommend the orange mango, the blackberry, for a little more flavor.

  This drink has made it possible for me to break my diet coke habit!  It is delicious; tastes somewhat like a pina colada, with some fizz.  Everyone I know who has tried this has fallen in love with it.  Try it; you won't be sorry.  (It is less expensive in my local grocery store than on Amazon, so check before you buy.)  There are other terrific flavors of Sparkling Ice, but this one is far and away the best.

And when we go to buy them in a grocery store they never have enough and when they do it's put the cases in the buggy, then out of the buggy at the register, then back in the buggy and push them in the cart only to take them back out of the buggy to put them car and then take them out of the car and lug them inside when you get home! These come to your home right to your door! It saves my husband's back, there is more room in the buggy to buy the other things we need! Glad somebody thought of this! Thank You!

  First thing to note is the taste is ridiculous strong. If you ever had those fruit juice in a frozen can it tastes similar to that, but lightly carbonated.To put in perspective the orange mango sort of tastes like a Fanta but 3x stronger and the Strawberry Kiwi is like a Capri Sun but 4-5x stronger and carbonated. If you or your children are sensitive to high sugar taste then you may want to stay away or find ways to dilute it (which may disrupt the carbonation)I like the thin profile of the bottle. Fits great in a bottle holder of a backpack, but may not be friendly to the cup holder in your car seeing how long the bottle is and with it's small base.Overall if you want a strong tasting carbonated beverage this is the product for you

  I used to be addicted to soda, particularly Diet Cola. I'm changing my habits and kicking caffeine but still wanted something that tasted great, had some light carbonation without chemicals, additives, Aspartame, caffeine, etc.I tried about 7 different options. They either had some caffeine or tasted bad or odd. Some had hardly any flavor.Sparkling ICE is very different. It has actual real juice flavors, no caffeine, has added vitamins and antioxidants and is sweetened with Sucralose which is much better for you. Plus, no calories!Best of all, it tastes great! They pack a lot of flavor in there with the natural juices.It's the perfect drink for drinking healthy.

  My husband and I love the Sparkling Ice line and have by now tried all the flavors but Pomegranate (see my other reviews).  I have to say that Kiwi Strawberry, tasting of neither kiwi nor strawberry, is my least favorite (I much prefer Diet Snapple's version of that flavor though I don't drink it when I'm dieting because it does have some calories).  My husband, though, doesn't mind it, so I'm pawning all those off on him while I glom the Orange Mango and Pink Grapefruit and the occasional Raspberry, though that's a bit sweet for me; he loves it. We also tried the Lemon Lime, which came in the 18-bottle assortment, and although I liked it I think it's going to be lots better as a mixer with vodka or tequila...can't wait till summer!I'd like to emphasize, though, that it's the Kiwi Strawberry flavor, not the product line, that I'm not crazy about. I'm thrilled with Sparkling Ice in general.

  These taste much better than I expected. I do wish there were more variety packs with different varieties, there’s always one you don’t like that much; would love to try other flavors but don’t want a whole 12 bottles of any single flavor. Some of these taste best with plenty of ice to dilute the candy flavored-ness. Overall they’re great cold sweet and SUGAR-FREE sparkling drinks, am already a happy repeat purchaser.

  Refreshing, clean sparkling drink. Wonderful substitute for sodas. Wish it didn't use artificial sweetener but glad that it is Splenda rather than aspartame. Maybe they can experiment with Stevia in the future.

  I only recently discovered Sparkling Ice and now it is one of my favorite drinks. The Coconut Pineapple flavor is very fruity with the pineapple flavor being a bit stronger than the coconut. This is very refreshing and Subscribe and Save allows me to always have plenty on hand. Like other products, you do need to keep an eye on fluctuating prices but each time I have ordered it has been comparable in price to my local stores.If you like pina colada's without the alcohol, you'll love this.

  I had really high hopes for these different flavors.  Unfortunately, two of the flavors, Kiwi Strawberry and Orange Mango, were awful.  I couldn't even get through one bottle of each.  Both were like an assault on my senses.  The Cherry Limeade wasn't all that good but I did manage to finish the bottle and I will drink the other two bottles eventually .  The Black Raspberry, however, was excellent and I plan to get more of this flavor.  I liked the level of ""sparkling"" in the sparkling water for all of the flavors.

  I bought this for something my children could take to school. There isn't much choice that doesn't have aluminum or plastic. Regardless, they strongly indicate that this product is all natural - it's not. I bought it based on what was shown in the ingredient list but that's incorrect. These actually have artificial coloring such as red and yellow artificial colors. I'm not sure why they need to add it or why Amazon can get away w/placing a list of ingredients that's incorrect but it is. Buyer beware. I gave it 2 stars b/c my kids do like them and they are easy to pack.

  As a bodybuilder, I have to watch my intake of sugars and calories in general. This is an awesome alternative to soda and other carbonated beverages, it has tones of taste with no calories! I drink one a couple times a week, I would definitely recommend them to anyone.

  I've grown to love Sparkling Ice and use it as a replacement for carbonated soda.  Still has some sugars in it but it's far better for you than drinking soda every day and it tastes pretty good!  Do be warned however that these usually retail for roughly $1 per bottle (or $12 for a 12 pack) and for some reason some of the prices on Amazon here lately have skyrocketed.  Thankfully my favorite flavor, Strawberry Watermelon, hasn't been too badly affected but if your want to try one of the other flavors you might want to go to your local store and see if they carry it.

  I LOVE the mango ICE.  It's so fizzy and sour and satisfying, with NO calories...(I hear you can find it at Costco in some markets, but I haven't found it yet).  I highly recommend ICE.

  I have been trying to wean myself off drinking so much diet soda (yes, sugar-free but so empty in nutrition and so full of aspartame) and drink more water, but I just hate plain water. And every time I try a ""vitamin water"" or something similar, I miss the fizz of carbonation in soda. This water is full of healthy things (vitamins and green tea extract) and all the flavors I've tried have been truly wonderful. But the kicker with this one is that great fizz! And the price is not bad at all for what you get in the 12-pack. I'm a convert!

  We love Sparkling ICE but this particular flavor (Lemonade) wasn't very sweet and actually had a chemically bitter taste. We tried it last year and liked it, but this time around it was horrible.

  I love Sparkling ICE and find it hard to enjoy water without it. I mix it with water to cut down on the flavor concentration and the sweetness.  I prefer the Sparkling ICE to LaCroix, because it is not as carbonated.This was part of my Subscribe and Save, but I was VERY disappointed to see such a huge price increase, more than 50%!!! Now it is even more expensive than in the grocery store, and as much as a price-gouging convenience store! Guess I'll be canceling my subscriptions.

  This is the best tasting carbonated water on the market today.  The flavoring is spot on.  i have tried multiple flavors like the Iced Tea, Orange Mango, Strawberry Lemonade and Raspberry Lemonade and one tastes better than the other.
